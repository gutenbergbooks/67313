<p class="center"><em>BY THE SAME AUTHOR</em></p>

<p class="center big2 p2">THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH</p>

<p class="center"><em>Uniform with this Volume.</em></p>


<p><b>Pall Mall Gazette.</b>&mdash;'A masterpiece. The story holds and haunts one.
Unequalled even by the great French contemporary whom, in his realism,
D’Annunzio most resembles, is the account of the pilgrimage to the shrine
of the Virgin by the sick, deformed, and afflicted. It is a great prose
poem, that of its kind cannot be surpassed. Every detail of the scene is
brought before us in a series of word-pictures of wonderful power and
vivid colouring, and the ever-recurring refrain, 'Viva Maria! Maria
Evviva!’ rings in our ears as we lay down the book. It is the work of a
master, whose genius is beyond dispute.’</p>

<p><b>Daily Telegraph.</b>&mdash;'The author gives us numerous delightful pictures,
pictures of Italian scenery, simple sketches, too, of ordinary, commonplace,
innocent lives. The range of his female portrait gallery is almost as wide
and varied as that of George Meredith. His Ippolita, his Marie Ferrès,
his Giuliana Hermil, live as strong and vivid presentments of real and
skilfully contrasted women. <em>The Triumph of Death</em> ends with a tragedy,
as it also begins with one. Between the two extremes are to be found
many pages of poetry, of tender appreciation of nature, of rare artistic skill,
of subtle and penetrative analysis.’</p>

<p><b>Daily News.</b>&mdash;'The close of the tragedy is swift and haunting. It is
impossible to overpraise the art. Every page is enriched with descriptive
passages of effects of nature, of music, of art, that arrest the imagination and
linger in the memory. In his words seem entangled the very breath and
sunshine of Italy&mdash;its translucent moonlight skies, its incomparable horizons.
It is difficult by quotation to do justice to the author’s power of giving the
vivid impression of a scene.’</p>

<p><b>Daily Chronicle.</b>&mdash;'The little effects of landscape are skilfully touched
in and harmonised with the emotion of the moment. The incidental
pictures of peasant life are most interesting, and the terrible pandemonium
at the shrine of Casalbordino is described with Zolaesque vigour.’</p>

<p><b>Scotsman.</b>&mdash;'The imaginative and penetrative force, the eloquence and
the artistic skill, are beyond question.’</p>

<p><b>Westminster Gazette.</b>&mdash;'For a vivid and searching description of the
Italian peasant on his religious side, written with knowledge and understanding,
these pages could hardly be surpassed. We see their Paganism,
and their poverty, and their squalor, yet also that imaginative temper
which lends a certain dignity to their existence. The narrative is remorseless
... yet it is rich and full of atmosphere. M. D’Annunzio has a
tender eye for natural detail; the landscape of Italy, its flowers and trees,
kindle him to genuine poetry. We are left at the close of his story with a
feeling that something like genius is at work. This book is one which will
not yield to any simple test. It is a work of singular power, which cannot
be ignored, left unread when once started, or easily banished from the
mind when read.’</p>

<p><b>The Morning Post.</b>&mdash;'It compels attention for its intense and minute
“realism” in the presentation of the relations of the man and the woman,
and equal intensity and minuteness in the description of things in general.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</span></p>


<p class="center p2 big2">THE CHILD OF PLEASURE</p>

<p class="center"><em>Uniform with this Volume.</em></p>

<p><b>Literature.</b>&mdash;'For the work of a man of twenty-five, this book is nothing
less than marvellous. There is no stumbling or hesitation in it. The
command of language, the confidence of thought, the knowledge of character
and sensation, displayed by D’Annunzio, at an age when the majority
of novelists and poets have been groping in the dark for style and substance,
are ever awe-inspiring. D’Annunzio began his career as a writer
of verse; his prose is written with the delight in language, the love of
words, of a poet.’</p>

<p><b>Manchester Guardian.</b>&mdash;'Wonderfully absorbing, for it is written with
a strange psychological intelligence, it is full of vivid descriptions, vehement
narrative, and contains pages of rare beauty in which an ideal language
really evokes the moods of the soul that it interprets. There is in the
novel some lovely verse which has been rendered with rare felicity by
Mr. Symons.’</p>

<p><b>Daily Graphic.</b>&mdash;'The wonderful beauty of the descriptions, the wealth
of colour, and most of all the realisation of a certain emotional pleasure
which the contemplation of the beautiful produces in some natures, this is
all so finely given, that if only as a study of human character the work
would be interesting. But the greatest merit of the book is the poetic
beauty and richness of the language, which makes it a glowing poem
in prose.’</p>


<p class="center p2 big2">THE VICTIM</p>

<p class="center"><em>Uniform with this Volume.</em></p>

<p><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>&mdash;'<em>The Victim</em> will most certainly not lessen the
enthusiasm of the English cult of D’Annunzio; it will, and should, attract
new admirers. No word but genius will fit his analysis of the mental
history of the faithless husband.... The genius of D’Annunzio is shown
alike in the bold directness of the conception, and the perfection with
which he works out every mental detail that follows therefrom, and
compels every sentence to do its full share of the work without effort. It
is a gloomy, saddening book, but a great one.’</p>

<p><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>&mdash;'The book contains many descriptive passages of
rare beauty, passages which by themselves are lovely little prose lyrics. It
is a story of a terrible experience told by the man who had endured it.
It is therefore a self-revelation; the revelation of the sort of self that
D’Annunzio delineates with a skill and knowledge so extraordinary. The
soul of the man, raw, bruised, bleeding, is always before us.’</p>

<p><b>The Daily Mail.</b>&mdash;'The vivid imagination of D’Annunzio’s novels, their
power of analysis, their grip of human emotions, and their grim truth,
are beyond dispute. In <em>The Victim</em> there is the same quality of genius
that was so readily recognisable in <em>The Triumph of Death</em> and in <em>The
Child of Pleasure</em>, and in reading it one is impressed anew with the young
author’s precise knowledge of life, his skill in interpretation, and his
earnestness. The whole narrative is so hauntingly real, that one cannot
put it aside until the end is reached.’</p>

<p class="p2">With these mortal eyes I beheld within a brief
space of time three peerless souls unfold and blossom,
and then wither away and perish one by one: the
most beautiful, most passionate, and most miserable
souls ever embodied in the latest descendants of a
haughty race.</p>

<p>From the scenes where their desolation, their pride,
and their grace wandered every day, clear and terrible
thoughts came to me, such as the most ancient
ruins of illustrious cities had never suggested. In
hopes of unravelling the mystery of their strange
ascendency, I used to explore the depths of the vast
ancestral mirrors, where, often unnoticed by themselves,
their three figures were reflected bathed in
a pallor like that which heralds dissolution after
death; and I gazed long and earnestly at the old,
worn-out things which they touched with their chilled
or fevered hands, using the same gestures perhaps as
had been used by other hands long since crumbled
into dust.</p>

<p>Was it thus, indeed, that I knew them in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
tedious monotony of daily life, or are they only
creations of my yearning desire and perplexity?</p>

<p>It was thus, indeed, that I knew them in the
tedious monotony of daily life, and yet they are
also creations of my yearning desire and perplexity.</p>

<p>That fragment of the web of my life, unconsciously
woven by them, is of such priceless value to me, that
I would fain embalm it in the strongest of spices to
prevent it from becoming faded or destroyed in me
by Time.</p>

<p>Therefore I now try the power of art.</p>

<p>Ah! but what magic could impart the coherency
of tangible and durable matter to that spiritual
texture which the three prisoners wove in the barren
monotony of their days, and embroidered little by
little with images of the noblest and most heart-rending
things in which human passion has ever
been hopelessly reflected?</p>

<p>Unlike the three ancient sisters, because victims
rather than daughters of necessity, they seemed
nevertheless, as they wove the richest zone of my
life, to be preparing the destiny of him who was to
come. Together they toiled, scarcely ever accompanying
their labour with a song, but less rarely
shedding visible tears&mdash;tears in which the essence of
their unexhausted, cloistered souls was sublimated.</p>

<p>And because from the first hour that I knew them
a dark cloud had overhung them, a cruel decree had
struck them to the heart, and left them discouraged
and gasping, and ready to die&mdash;all their attitudes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
and gestures and lightest words seemed to me heavy
with a meaning of which they, in their profound
unconsciousness, were ignorant.</p>

<p>Bending and breaking as they were beneath the
weight of their own maturity, like autumn trees
overladen with bounteous fruit, they were unable
either to sound the depth of their misery or to give
voice to it. Their anguished lips revealed to me
only a small portion of their secrets. But I could
understand the ineffable things spoken by the blood
flowing in the veins of their beautiful bare hands.</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em; "><span class="smcap">Leonardo da Vinci.</span><br /></p>

<p class="p2">The hour which preceded my arrival in the ancestral
garden, where they awaited me, seems to me&mdash;as I
see it in imagination&mdash;illuminated with a light of
unaccustomed poetry.</p>

<p>To him who knows what slow or sudden fertilisations,
what unexpected transfigurations, are possible
to an intense soul communicating with other souls in
the vicissitudes of this most uncertain life&mdash;to him
for whom the whole dignity of existence lies in
exerting or submitting to a moral force, and who
approaches his kind with a secret anxiety to dominate
or be dominated&mdash;to every man who is curious
about the inner mystery, who is ambitious of spiritual
power, or feels the need of slavery, no hour has such
a charm as that in which he moves forward, with a
vague anticipation, to meet the living Unknown and
Infinite, a dim world which he will either conquer,
or by which he will be absorbed.</p>

<p>I was about to enter an enclosed garden. There
the three virgin princesses were awaiting the friend
who had been absent so long, him to whom, as their
contemporary in age, they were bound by recollections
of childhood and adolescence, him who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
sole heir to a name no less ancient and distinguished
than their own. And thus they were awaiting the
return of an equal, of a sojourner in great cities, one
who should bring them a breath of that larger life
which they had renounced.</p>

<p>And each one of them perhaps in her secret heart
was awaiting the Bridegroom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This time of waiting appears to me vehement in
its anxiety when I think of the bare and gloomy
solitude of the house in which, until that day, they
had languished, their beautiful hands overflowing
with the treasures of youth, surrounded by a phantom
pomp of existence called up by their mother’s
delirium to people the emptiness of the vast mirrors.
There, as if in twilight pools, the raving soul of the
mother was wont to be immersed. On the infinite
distance of those colourless expanses, had not each
one of the maidens beheld the apparition of the
youthful, ardent figure of the Bridegroom who was
to tear her from this obscure decay, and carry her
away in a whirlwind of delight?</p>

<p>Thus each one waited anxiously within her enclosed
garden for the coming of him who was only after all
to delude her, to watch her perish without possessing
her.</p>

<p>“Ah! which of us will be the elect?”</p>

<p>Never perhaps&mdash;so I think&mdash;were their beautiful
dim eyes so earnestly strained as at that hour; those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
eyes dimmed by melancholy and weariness, the light
of inquiry quenched in them by too long familiarity
with never-changing objects: eyes dimmed by mutual
pity, reflecting the forms of familiar things without
mystery or variety, in hard outlines and lifeless
colouring.</p>

<p>And suddenly each of them perceived in the other
a new creature, armed for combat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I know not if there be anything sadder than these
lightning-like revelations made to tender hearts by
the desire for happiness. The virtuous sisters
breathed in the same circle of sorrow; the same
destiny weighed upon them; and during the evenings,
heavy with anxiety, one of them from time to
time would lay her brow on the shoulder or the
breast of another, while the darkness effaced the
diversity of their faces, and fused their three souls in
one. But when the prophesied guest&mdash;to their waiting
hearts already appearing with the gestures of the
lover who elects and who promises&mdash;was about to set
foot on their deserted threshold, they lifted up their
heads with a thrill, and loosed their clasped hands,
and exchanged a look which had the violence of a
sudden flash of lightning. And while from the depth
of their troubled souls there welled up an unknown
feeling which had none of the old sweetness, that one
look brought them consciousness at last of all their
waning grace, of the contrast between their three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
figures coloured by the same blood, of the spirit of
night lurking in the mass of hair heaped up like a
load on the nape of a white neck, of the marvellous
persuasion expressed by the curve of a silent mouth,
of the enchantment woven like a net by the ingenuous
frequency of some inimitable gesture, and of
every other magic power.</p>

<p>And a dim instinct of strife dismayed them.</p>

<p>Thus do I picture to myself those who were waiting
for me in that glowing hour.</p>

<p>The first breath of spring, faintly warm, which had
touched the dry summits of the rocks, was caressing
the brows of the anxious maidens. Within the
great cloister, carpeted with jonquils and violets, the
fountains repeated the melodious accompaniment
which for centuries the waters had made to the
thoughts of voluptuousness and of wisdom expressed
in the leonine verses on the pediment. On certain
trees and on certain bushes the delicate leaves were
shining as though coated with gum or diaphanous
wax. The ancient and immovable things of time
which could only decay were touched with an indefinable
softness, communicated to them by the
things that had power to renew themselves.</p>

<p>“Ah, which of us will be the chosen one?”</p>

<p>The three sisters, who had secretly become rivals
in face of this deceptive offer of apparent life,
composed their attitudes according to the inward
rhythm of their natural beauty, which time had
already begun to threaten. Perhaps not till that
day had they understood that beauty in its true sense;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
just as a sick person, hearing the unaccustomed
sound of the blood beating in the ear which presses
the pillows, for the first time understands the portentous
music which sustains his feeble frame.</p>

<p>But perhaps in them this rhythm had no words.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I can now distinctly hear the words
of that rhythm within me, strengthening the pure
outlines of those ideal figures.</p>

<p>“A boundless desire for slavery makes me suffer,”
says Massimilla silently, as she sits on the stone
seat, her hands, with fingers interwoven, clasped
round her weary knee. “I have not the gift of communicating
happiness; but my whole being, more
than any other creature, more than any inanimate
thing, is ready to become the perfect and perpetual
possession of a master.</p>

<p>“A boundless desire for slavery makes me suffer.
I am devoured by an unquenchable yearning to give
myself up entirely, to belong to a higher and stronger
being, to dissolve myself in his will, to burn like a
holocaust in the fire of his great soul. I envy the
frail things which lose themselves, which are swallowed
up in an abyss, or carried away by a whirlwind; and
I gaze often and long at the drops of water which fall
into the great basin, and hardly awake the slightest
smile on its surface.</p>

<p>“When a perfume envelopes me and vanishes,
when a sound reaches me and dies out, sometimes
I feel myself grow pale and almost faint away, for it
seems to me that the aroma and the harmony of my
life are tending to the same evanescence. And yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
sometimes my little soul is straitened within me like
a knot. Who shall untie it and absorb it?</p>

<p>“Ah me! perhaps I should not know how to
console him in his sadness; but my dumb and
anxious face should be always turned towards his,
quick to perceive hope reviving in his secret heart.
Perhaps I should not know how to let fall on his
silence those rare syllables, seeds of the soul, which
in a moment can generate a boundless dream; but
no faith in the world should surpass the ardour of
my faith as I listened, even when the things I heard
were such as must remain inaccessible to my intellect.</p>

<p>“I am she who listens, admires, and is silent.</p>

<p>“From my birth I bear on my forehead between my
eyebrows the sign of attention.</p>

<p>“I have learned from the calm and intensity of
statues the immobility of harmonious attitude. I can
keep my eyes open and turned upwards for a long
time, because my eyelids are light.</p>

<p>“The shape of my lips forms the living and visible
image of the word 'Amen.’”</p>

<p>“I suffer,” says Anatolia, “from a virtue within me
which is wasting itself uselessly. My strength is the
last support of a solitary ruin, whereas it might safely
guide the current of a river full of all life’s abundance
from its source to the sea.</p>

<p>“My heart is inexhaustible. All the sorrows of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
world could never succeed in wearying its throbs; the
fiercest violence of joy could not break it, nor can it
be weakened by this long and slow grief. A vast
multitude of thirsty creatures might drink of the well
of its tenderness without exhausting it.</p>

<p>“Ah! why should fate condemn me to this narrow
duty, to this slow torture? Why should she forbid
me that sublime union for which my heart yearns?</p>

<p>“I could guide the soul of a man up to that highest
sphere where the value of the act and the splendour
of the dream converge to the selfsame apex; from
the depths of his unconsciousness I could extract
unseen energies which lie hidden like ore in the veins
of rough stone.</p>

<p>“The most hesitating of men would feel secure by
my side; he who had strayed from the light would
once more see a steady beacon at the end of his path;
he who had been buffeted about and maimed would
become healthy and whole again. My hands know
how to bind up wounds, and how to tear the bandages
off heavy eyelids. When I stretch them out&mdash;my
purest heart’s-blood flows magnetically to the tips
of my fingers.</p>

<p>“I possess the two supreme gifts which enrich life,
and prolong it beyond the illusion of death: I fear
no suffering, and I feel the imprint of eternity on my
thoughts and acts.</p>

<p>“And therefore I am troubled by a desire to create&mdash;to
become through love her who propagates and
perpetuates the ideal qualities of a race favoured by
Heaven. I could nourish the superhuman within me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“Once in a dream I kept mysterious watch a whole
night long over the sleep of a child. While with
deep-drawn breaths his body lay slumbering I upheld
his soul in my hands, and it was tangible like
a globe of crystal, and my breast swelled with marvellous
premonitions.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Violante says: “I am humbled. When I felt the
mass of my hair weigh upon my brow, I fancied myself
to be wearing a crown, and beneath that regal
burden my thoughts wore a purple hue.</p>

<p>“My childhood’s memories are all lit up by visions
of fire and slaughter. Blood ran before my innocent
eyes; my delicate nostrils breathed the odour of
unburied corpses. A young and eager queen, hunted
from her throne, took me in her arms before she
departed into an exile from which there was no
return. From that time, therefore, the splendour of
great and tragic destinies hangs over my soul.</p>

<p>“In my dreams I have lived a thousand lives of
magnificence; I have passed through all sovereignties
as safely as one who retraces a well-known path;
I have discovered in the aspect of the most dissimilar
things secret analogies with the aspect of my own
form, and by hidden arts have pointed them out for
man to wonder at; and I have found out how to
compel light and shade, as truly as robes and jewels,
to form the divine and unforeseen adornment of my
decline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“Poets saw in me the ideal apparition in whose
lineaments the highest mystery of life is expressed&mdash;that
mystery of beauty which has been revealed
in mortal flesh at intervals of long ages, through
all the imperfection of innumerable generations.
And they thought: 'This is doubtless the perfected
image of that idea of which the peoples of the
earth have had an intuition from the beginning, and
which artists have unceasingly invoked in poems,
in symphonies, on canvas, in clay. Everything in
her is expressive, everything is a symbol. The lines
of her form speak a language whose eternal truth
would make him that could understand it like unto
a god; and her slightest movements produce within
the contours of her body ineffable music like the
harmony of midnight skies.’</p>

<p>“But now I am humbled&mdash;deprived of my kingdoms.
The fire in my blood is growing paler and
dying out. I shall vanish away, less fortunate than
the statues which testified to the joy of life on the
brows of the cities of the past. For ever unknown,
I shall dissolve away, whereas they will endure in
the safe keeping of mould and darkness among the
roots of the flowers, and some day, when unburied,
they will seem to the ecstatic soul of kneeling poets
as great as the gifts of earth.</p>

<p>“I have now dreamed every dream, and my hair
weighs heavier on my brow than a hundred crowns.
I have dazed myself with perfumes. I love to linger
near the fountains as they go on eternally telling the
same tale. Through the thick locks of hair which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
cover my ears I seem to hear time ebbing away on
the monotonous waters.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus when I evoke them do the three princesses
speak within my soul, as they wait for the irrevocable
hour. Thus, perhaps, believing that a messenger
of life had appeared at the gates of their
closed garden, did each one recognise her own charm,
display her own seductiveness, revive her own hope,
quicken the dream within her which had almost died
away.</p>

<p>O Hour! lit up by grand and solemn poetry!
Most brilliant Hour in which all possibilities emerged
and shone on the inward heaven of the soul!</p>

<p class="p2">After the inevitable tumult of early youth had
been controlled, the vehemence of conflicting desires
defeated, and a barrier raised against the confused
and multifold overflow of sensations, I had sought
during the momentary silence that ensued on my consciousness
to find out whether life might not become
something different from the usual exercise of the
faculties of adaptation to changing circumstances;
that is to say, whether my will might not be able, by
means of selection and exclusion, to build up some
new and artistic work out of the elements which life
had already stored up within me.</p>

<p>I felt assured, after some self-examination, that
my consciousness had reached that arduous point
when it becomes possible to appreciate this too
simple axiom: The world represents the sensibility
and the thought of a few superior men who created
it, and in course of time have enlarged and adorned
it, and who in the future will continue to enlarge and
adorn it more and more. The world, as it appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
to us to-day, is a magnificent gift from the few to
the many, from free men to slaves, from those who
think and feel to those who work. And then I
recognised my own highest ambition in the desire
to bring some ornament, to add some new value to
this human world which is being eternally embellished
with beauty and sorrow.</p>

<p>Face to face with my own soul, I thought again
of that dream which came to Socrates several times
over, each time taking a different form, but always
urging him to fulfil the same mission: “O Socrates,
compose and cultivate music.” Then I learned that
the real duty of a man of worth is to discover in the
course of his existence a series of harmonies, varied
indeed, but controlled by one dominant motive, and
bearing the impress of one style. And so it appeared
to me that the ancient sage, who excelled in the art
of raising the human soul to its utmost degree of
vigour, might teach a great and efficacious lesson to
our own age.</p>

<p>By the study of himself and his neighbours, this
man discovered what inestimable benefits assiduous
discipline bent always to a fixed purpose can confer
upon life. His supreme wisdom seems to me most
resplendent in this, that he did not place his Ideal
out of the reach of daily practice, beyond the sphere
of necessary realities, but that he made it the living
centre of his being, and deduced his own laws from
it; and, in accordance with these laws, he developed
rhythmically throughout the course of years, exercising
with calm pride such rights as they permitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
him, and separating&mdash;he a citizen of Athens under
the tyranny of the Thirty, and under the tyranny
of the plebeians&mdash;deliberately separating his moral
existence from that of the city. He desired, and
he was able to preserve himself for himself until
death. “I will be obedient to God only,” meant, “I
will be obedient only to the laws of that genius to
which, in order to fulfil my conception of order and
beauty, I have subjected my free nature.”</p>

<p>Far more subtle as an artist than Apelles or Protogenes,
he was able to trace with a firm hand the
complete image of himself in one continuous line.
And the sublime joy of the last evening came to him,
not from the hope of that other life which he had
spoken of in his discourses, but rather from the vision
of his own image, made one with death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ah, why cannot he live again on Latin soil, this
Master who understood with such profound and
hidden art how to awaken and stimulate all the
energies of intellect and soul in those who approached
to listen to him?</p>

<p>A strange melancholy used to fall over me in my
youth when, reading the Dialogues, I tried to picture
to myself that circle of eager and anxious disciples
surrounding him. I used to admire the handsome
ones, those dressed in the richest garments, and
on whom his round and prominent eyes&mdash;those <em>new</em>
eyes of his, in which there was a look <em>peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
to himself</em>&mdash;rested oftenest. My imagination prolonged
the adventures of the strangers who came
to him from afar, like the Thracian Antisthenes, who
travelled forty stadia a day to hear him, and like
Euclides, who&mdash;the Athenians having forbidden the
citizens of Megara to enter Athens, and decreed the
worst of punishments for the transgressors&mdash;dressed
himself in woman’s clothes, and thus clothed and
veiled, left his own city towards evening, and made
a long journey in order to be present at the discourses
of the Sage; then at dawn went on his way
again in the same disguise, his breast filled with
unquenchable enthusiasm. And I felt touched by
the fate of the beautiful Elian youth Phaedo, who,
after having been made a prisoner of war in his
own country, and sold to the keeper of a house
of ill-fame, escaped to Socrates, and by his means
obtained redemption and admission to the feasts of
pure thought.</p>

<p>It seemed to me, indeed, that this genial master
surpassed the Nazarene in generosity. Perhaps the
Hebrew, if his enemies had not slain him in the
flower of his years, would at last have shaken off
the weight of his sadness, found new savour in the
ripe fruits of his Galilee, and pointed out a different
ideal of good to his followers. The Greek philosopher
had always loved life; he loved it, and taught men
to love it. Nearly infallible as a prophet and seer,
he welcomed all souls in which his penetrating glance
had discovered any force, and in each one he developed
and elevated that natural force, so that all those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
inspired by his fire revealed themselves in the power
of their diversity. The highest value of his method
was that very result of which his enemies accused
him: that from his school&mdash;where met honest Crito
and Plato, the follower of Urania, and the raving
Apollodorus, and the kindly Theætetus, who is like
a noiseless river of oil&mdash;there went forth also the
luxurious Cyrenian, Aristippus, and Critias, the most
violent of the Thirty Tyrants, and the other tyrant
Charicles, and that marvellous breaker of laws, Alcibiades,
who put no limit to his premeditated violence.
“My heart leaps when I hear his discourses far more
than at the sound of the Corybantes,” said the son of
Clinia, like a graceful wild animal crowned with ivy
and violets, at the close of a banquet where the guests
had received from Silenus’ mouth the grand initiation
of Diotima. No fairer wreath of praise was ever
woven to deify any man upon earth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, what were the energies stimulated in me by
this master? What harmonies did he lead me to
find?</p>

<p>At first he captivated me by his singular faculty
of feeling the fascination even of evanescent beauty,
of making, with a certain restraint, distinctions among
ordinary pleasures, and of recognising the value which
the idea of death confers upon the grace of earthly
things.</p>

<p>Pure and austere as he was in the act of speculation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
he yet possessed such exquisitely fine senses that
they might almost be called the skilled artists of his
sensations.</p>

<p>No guest at any of the banquets&mdash;according to
Alcibiades, an excellent judge&mdash;knew so well how
to enjoy them as he. At the beginning of the
banquet of Xenophon, he, with the others, contemplates
the perfect beauty of Autolycus in long silence,
almost as if he recognised in it some superhuman
presence. Afterwards he discourses, with subtle taste,
of perfumes, dancing, and drinking, not without vivid
images to adorn his discourse, as becomes a sage and
a poet.</p>

<p>Thus, while contending with Critobulus in jest for
the palm of beauty, he uttered these words: “Since
my lips are thicker, thinkest thou not that my kiss
must be softer than thine?” He advised the Syracusan,
who gave a performance there of dancing, in
which a flute-player, a marvellous dancing-girl, and
a boy harpist took part, not to force the three young
bodies to unnatural efforts and into dangerous postures,
which give no pleasure to the spectator, but to
leave it to their youthful freshness, accompanied by
the sound of the flute, to fall into such attitudes as
belong to the Nymphs, the Graces, or the Hours as
they are commonly painted. And so to the disorder
which only amazes he opposes the order which
pleases, and stands revealed once again as a cultivator
of music and a master of style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>That which in days gone by touched me more
than anything else were his last words to a beautiful
frail creature whom he loved. They touch me still,
for my soul loves now and then to slacken its tension
in the voluptuous sadness and passionate perplexity
which the sense of continual change, continual
passing away, continual decay, is apt to produce in
a life adorned by the noblest culture.</p>

<p>In the dialogue of the last evening I am not so
much moved by the scene where Crito, charged by
him who was to administer the hemlock, interrupts
the condemned man’s discourse, and admonishes him
not to heat himself if he wishes the poison to take
rapid effect, and the brave man smiles and goes on
with his inquiry; nor is the musical simile of the
swan magicians and their harmonious joy so dear to
me; nor am I so amazed by those last moments,
when in brief actions and brief sayings this man
fulfils his ideal of perfection so clearly, and, like an
artist who has given the finishing touch to his work,
gazes contentedly at his own image&mdash;a miracle of
style&mdash;destined for ever to remain immortal upon
earth; I am not touched by any of these as I am
by that unexpected pause which follows the doubts
opposed by Cebes and Simmias to the certainty
displayed by the eloquent master.</p>

<p>It was a profound pause, during which all those
souls were suddenly blinded and cast, as it were,
into an abyss after the ray of light thrown upon the
great Mystery by him who was about to enter it had
suddenly died out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>The master guessed the sadness produced among
his faithful followers by this sudden gloom, and the
wings of his thought soon spread again. Reality
appeared to him through the medium of the senses,
and held him back for a while in the field of the finite
and the perceptible. He felt time fly, life flow on.
Perhaps his ears caught some sound from the stately
city, perhaps his nostrils inhaled the perfume of the
early summer just approaching as his eyes rested on
Phaedo with the beautiful hair.</p>

<p>Seated on his bed, with Phaedo beside him on
a low stool, he laid his hand on the head of his
disciple, and caressed him and stroked the hair on
his neck, for it was a habit of his thus to let his
fingers stray playfully in that thick young forest.
Still he did not speak, so intense was his emotion,
and so chequered with delight. Through this beautiful
and ephemeral living being he was communicating
once more with that earthly life in which he had
attained his perfection, in which he had realised his
ideal of virtue; and perhaps he felt that there was
nothing beyond, that this finished existence of his
was sufficient to itself, that its prolongation in eternity
was only&mdash;like the halo of a star&mdash;an illusion produced
by the extraordinary radiance of his humanity.
Never had the locks of the young Elian been so sublimely
precious to him. He was enjoying them for
the last time, for he had to die; indeed, he knew that
next day those locks would be cut off in sign of
mourning. At last he said&mdash;and his disciples had
never known such a tone in his voice before&mdash;he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
said: “To-morrow, oh Phaedo, thou wilt cut off these
beautiful locks.” And the youth answered: “So it
seems, oh Socrates.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This sentiment&mdash;which I at once absorbed and
exalted within me as I read the episode for the first
time in the Platonic dialogue&mdash;became afterwards by
means of analogy so complex and so familiar to my
mind, that I made it the open or concealed theme of
that music to which I wished to hearken.</p>

<p>In this way the Ancient Sage taught me the commemoration
of death in a manner conformable to
my nature, that I might find a rarer value and a
graver significance in things near at hand. And he
taught me to seek and discover in my own nature
genuine virtues and genuine defects, that I might
arrange both in accordance with a premeditated
design, striving with patient care to give a seemly
appearance to the latter, and to raise the former
upwards towards the supreme perfection. And he
taught me to exclude everything which was discordant
with my ruling idea, everything which could
alter the lines of my design, which could slacken or
interrupt the rhythmical development of my thought.
And he taught me to discern with sure intuition
those souls over whom to exercise benevolence or
mastery, or from whom to obtain some extraordinary
revelation. And at last he communicated to me also
his faith in the <em>dæmon</em>, which was none other than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the mysteriously significant power of Style, inviolable
by any, even by himself in his own person.</p>

<p>Full of this teaching and quite alone, I set to work,
with the hope of succeeding, in tracing with precise
and strong outlines that effigy of myself, to whose
existence so many remote causes had contributed,
operating from time immemorial through an infinite
number of generations. That virtue of race, which
in Socrates’ country was called <em>eugeneia</em>, came out
stronger and stronger as my discipline became
more severe; and my pride increased with my satisfaction
as I thought how only too many other souls
would have sooner or later revealed their vulgar
essence under the ordeal of that fire. But sometimes
from the very roots of my being&mdash;where the indestructible
soul of ancestors slumbers&mdash;such positive
and vehement fountains of energy would spring up,
that I felt sad as I recognised their uselessness in an
epoch when public life is only a miserable spectacle
of meanness and dishonour. “It is marvellous indeed,”
the <em>dæmon</em> used to say to me, “that these ancient
barbaric energies should have been preserved in thee
with all their freshness. They are still beautiful even
though they be inopportune. In another age they
would assist in performing the duty worthy of such
as thee; that is to say, the duty of the leader who
points out a certain goal, and guides his followers
towards it. As that day seems far off, do thou now
attempt, by condensing these energies, to transform
them into living poetry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Very distant indeed that day appeared; for even
the arrogance of the populace was not so great as
the cowardice of those who tolerated and supported
it. Living in Rome as I did, I was witness of the
most ignominious breaches of faith, of the most
obscene connections which ever dishonoured a sacred
spot. Evil-doers gathered together within the fatal
circle of the divine city as within the precincts of an
infamous forest, and it seemed as though only some
magnificent power armed with ideas more brilliant
than past memories could be able nowadays to raise
its head above the monstrous phantoms of empire.
Like the overflow of sewers, the flood of base desires
was invading the market-place and the cross-roads, a
flood perpetually swelling and growing more putrid,
never even illuminated by any flame of crooked but
titanic ambition, never even bursting out in a flash of
magnificent crime. The lonely dome on the distant
side of the Tiber, inhabited by a soul, which although
senile, yet stood firm in the consciousness of its own
aims, was still the most prominent landmark, contrasted
as it was with another unnecessarily exalted dwelling-place,
where a king of warlike race showed a wonderful
example of patience in the fulfilment of the
humble and fatiguing office assigned to him by the
decree of the people.</p>

<p>One evening in September, as I stood on that
acropolis of the Quirinal guarded by the twin Tindarides,
while a dense crowd was commemorating
with bestial howls a conquest, the frightful extent of
which they could not understand (Rome was looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
terrible as a crater under a conflagration of clouds), I
thought to myself: “What visions might not these
conflagrations of the Latin sky kindle in the great
heart of a king? Such a vision that under its weight
the gigantic horses of Praxiteles would bend like
twigs. Ah, who will ever be able to embrace the
great Mother and fertilise her with his all-powerful
idea? To her alone&mdash;within her womb of stone,
which for ages has been the pillow of Death&mdash;to her
alone it is given to generate such abundance of life
that the world may be renewed with it again.”</p>

<p>And behind the glittering windows of the royal
balcony I saw in imagination a pale contracted brow,
carved like the brow of the Corsican with the mark
of a superhuman destiny.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But what signified this turbid seething of servile
passions, seen through that silence which surrounds
Rome with its nine circles like a river of Tartarus?
I was consoled for all my disappointment by this
sublime spectacle of the Campagna strewn with
great dead things, where nothing ever springs up
save blades of grass, germs of fever, and terrible
thoughts. “Is there a new nation struggling within
the walls of the city? Ere long a few ashes will be
borne to me on the wind. My barrenness is made
of a layer of ashes, some precious and some ignoble.
And the iron for the plough which shall furrow me
has not yet been drawn from the mountain.” This is
what the sepulchre of the nations signified to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>And yet, though the sight of that voracious desert
be a sinister warning to an unprofitable nation, it can
inspire the solitary man with the wildest intoxication
of which the soul is capable. From the crevices of
that soil a feverish vapour ascends like smoke, and
works like a magic philtre in the blood of some
men, producing a form of madness unlike any
other.</p>

<p>The young men of the Garibaldian troops, I thought,
must have felt themselves possessed by this madness
as they entered the Campagna. They were suddenly
transfigured by a flame which consumed them like
dry wood. And in one here and there that fever
magnified his own inward vision in such a way that
he ceased to form part of a compact and unanimous
band, and assumed an individuality of his own, a
singularly warlike aspect, consecrated to a new
onward movement. Fair and noble of race like a
virgin hero of the time of Ajax, the type of the old
warlike ideal, strengthened by a spirit of unexampled
ardour, which came to him from the soil he trod,
seemed to be renewed in such an one as he fell.</p>

<p>I envied him that happy fate which was denied to
me. Several times after these inspiring reflections, a
furious desire to prove my valour consumed me, and
I would put my horse at some very high piece of
ruined wall, and, the useless danger overcome, I
would feel that always and everywhere I should have
known how to die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>I remember as one of the most intense periods in
my life an autumn passed in daily communion with
the Latian desert.</p>

<p>Over that theatre, where a drama of races unfolded
itself before my mental vision, there passed a perpetual
variety of clouds whose great fleeting shadows
made the commentary on my inward musings.
Sometimes the silence became so heavy, and the
odour of death wafted up in my face from the grass
so suffocating, that instinctively I clung closer to my
horse, as though I wished to feel a share in his
impetuous vitality. Then the fine powerful animal
would spring forward with feline agility, and the
inextinguishable fire burning in his pure blood would
seem to communicate itself to me. Then for a
few minutes I tasted intoxication. As I followed the
line in which I was carried by the impetus of the
gallop and the thoughts in my mind, a line parallel
to the vast skeletons of the aqueducts which crowded
the horizon, I felt the birth and growth within me of
an indescribable spirit of fervour&mdash;a mixture of
physical impulse, of intellectual pride and of confused
hopes; and my energies were stimulated and
multiplied by the presence of those works of man, of
those human witnesses outliving total death, of those
terrible reddened arches which for centuries have
risen unconquered in procession against the menaces
of heaven.</p>

<p>Alone, without near relations, without any ordinary
ties, independent of any domestic authority, absolute
master of myself and of my goods, I felt most profoundly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
in that solitude&mdash;more than at any other
time or place&mdash;the sense of my progressive and
voluntary evolution towards an ideal Latin type.
Day after day I felt my whole nature grow, under the
rigorous discipline of meditation, selection, and exclusion;
and its special characteristics, its distinct peculiarities,
become more marked. The aspect of the
country, precise and sober in form and colour, was a
continual example and a continual stimulus to me; it
had an efficacy for my intellect like that of dogmatic
teaching. Each group of lines seemed indeed to be
inscribed on the heavens with the pithy significance
of an incisive axiom and the unvarying character of
a single style.</p>

<p>But the marvellous virtue of this teaching was, that
although it drove me to order my inner life with
the exactness of a ruled design, it did not dry up
the spontaneous springs of emotion and imagination,
indeed it only stimulated them to greater activity.
Of a sudden, some single thought would become so
intense and so ardent within me that it would
possess me almost to delirium, like a phantom
created by an illusion; and by it my whole world
would be strewn with shadows and new lights. A
jet of poetry would burst from my inner being, filling
my whole soul with music and ineffable freshness,
and causing desires and hopes to burn higher in a
happy flame. Thus sometimes on the Campagna the
autumn sunset would pour out the impalpable lava of
its eruption; long sulphur-coloured streams furrowed
the uneven plain; the hollows were filled with darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
like abysses just opened; the aqueducts caught
fire from base to summit; the whole country seemed
to have returned to its volcanic origin in the dawn
of time. Thus sometimes in the morning the larks
would start suddenly out of the soft sparkling grass,
singing as they made their dizzy ascent, like spirits
of joy rapt higher and higher from mortal sight into
the purest heaven of blue, and to my wondering
soul the whole dome of heaven seemed to be echoing
with their intoxicating music.</p>

<p>And so this solitude more than any other was able
to inspire the degree of enthusiasm and reasonableness
necessary for an ambitious ascetic: an ascetic
in the original meaning of the austere word, desiring,
like the ancient antagonists, to prepare himself by
rigid discipline for the struggles and the conquests
of the earth.</p>

<p>“What pillar of fire, what burning desert, what
lonely mountain top, what bottomless cave, what
malarious pool, what solitary, barren, or tragic spot
can be surpassed by this place, in the power of
kindling the sacred spark of madness in one who
believes himself destined to engrave on new tables of
stone new laws for the religious guidance of the
people?” Thus I used to think while presentiments
of forms yet uncreated arose within me, fostered by
that same silence in which so many extinct forms of
our humanity were gathered together. Everything
there is dead, but everything might suddenly come
to life again in some spirit with enough superfluity
of strength and heat to accomplish the prodigy. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
is difficult to imagine the grandeur and terror of such
a resurrection. He within whose consciousness it
could be realised would appear to himself and others
to be possessed by a mysterious and incalculable force
greater far than that which used to assail the Pythia
of old. Instead of the fury of a god present on the
tripod, his mouth would express that very genius of
the races which is the funereal guardian of innumerable
destinies long ago fulfilled. His oracle would
not be merely a chink opened into a world above the
senses, but the sum of all human wisdom mingled
with the breath of Earth, that highest of prophetesses,
according to the message of Æschylus. And once
again the multitudes would bend before the divine
aspect of his madness; not as at Delphi, to implore
the dark utterances of the ambiguous God, but to
receive the clear answer given by previous existences,
that answer which the Nazarene never gave. He
was too illiterate, and the desert beneath the mountains
of Judea on the western bank of the Dead Sea,
in which he chose to find his revelation, was too
stony: a place of rocks and precipices, destitute of
foot-prints, blind to all thought. The solitary youth
felt no fear of famishing jackals, but he feared
thought. His pale hand had power to tame savage
beasts, but thoughts as fiery and masterful as those
which wander over the Latian desert would have
devoured him. When the bad angel drove him to
the top of the mountain and showed him the fertile
land below, and pointed out the position of the
different countries of the world and the deep and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
whirling currents of human desire, he closed his
eyelids: he would not see, he would not know.
But the great Revealer must extend the horizon of
his consciousness beyond all limits, and embrace
within it days and years, centuries and millenniums.
The truth he sets forth must be the outcome of the
whole life lived by men up to the present hour. It
must be a fire in which the ascending powers of many
generations may be absorbed; so that thus harmonised
and multiplied, they may move onward in
greater unison and with greater certainty towards an
ever purer ideal.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, I was haunted by the phantom
of him, whom one day believed to have created
King of Rome. “There was lacking,” I used to
think, “even in this most admirable inspirer of heroic
feeling, in this joyful revenger of youthful blood, there
was lacking the ascetic discipline of the sepulchre
of the nations. Had he been able even for a
time to turn aside his spirit from the things which
pressed upon him and bend it towards immutable
things, he might have discovered some idea greater
than his own mortal person, and might have chosen
it to be ruler of his actions. Then his dream of
Latin empire would have grown closer and weightier
and more tenacious, so that the force of events and
himself combined could not have finally dissipated
and destroyed it as they did. But his idea, which
was too much bound up with daily life, too human in
fact, was to die with him. He never attained knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
of the secret by which man prolongs the
efficacy of his action into all time. The impulses
given by the man were as vehement as they could
be, but their propagation was brief and uncertain,
because they originated in a centre of spontaneous
powers which were not subject to any superior conception
evolved from a severe order of meditation.
And so his work was not higher than himself, and
lasted no longer than the work of destruction. His
destiny was controlled by the old oracles. The
answer given by the Pythia as to the fate of Corinth
might, after thousands of years, serve for him
also:&mdash;<em>An eagle has conceived by a rock, and shall
give birth to a fierce lion, greedy for human flesh,
which shall work great slaughter.</em>&mdash;He did but obey
the prediction, like the petty tyrant Cypselus. And
the King of Rome faded away into space like a
column of smoke.”</p>

<p>Such was the colour of the thoughts awakened in
me by the aspect of a place which&mdash;according to
Dante’s words&mdash;seemed formed by nature herself for
universal empire: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad universaliter principandum</i>.
And while Dante’s arguments to prove the divine
right of the Roman power recurred to my memory, the
summit of my intellect was occupied by that motto
which the Latin races, if they wish to be born again,
would do well to adopt in its exact and rigid form as
the rule of their vital institutions:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maxima nobile,
maxima præesse convenit.</i> It is meet that the noblest
should also be the greatest.</p>

<p>And in the company of that great and tyrannical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
spirit I used to think: “Oh, venerable father of our
language, thou hadst faith in the necessity of hierarchies
and differences between men; thou didst
believe in the superiority of the virtue transmitted
through heredity in the blood; thou didst firmly
believe in a virtue of race which can by degrees,
by one selection after another, elevate man to
the highest splendour of his moral beauty. When
thou didst expound the genealogy of Æneas, thou
sawest a manner of divine predestination in the concourse
of blood.” Now, what mysterious concourse
of blood, what vast experience of culture, what propitious
harmony of circumstances shall give birth to
the new King of Rome? <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Natura ordinatus ad imperandum</i>&mdash;ordained
by nature unto empire&mdash;but,
unlike any other monarch, his task will not be to
reconfirm or raise the value which&mdash;under the
influence of various teachings&mdash;the nations have been
used to set upon the things of life; it will rather be
to abolish or invert them. Conscious of the whole
significance of those events which compose man’s
history, and familiar with the essence of all the
supreme wills which have directed important movements,
he will be capable of the work of construction,
and of throwing out towards the future that ideal
bridge by which the privileged races will at last be
able to cross the abyss now apparently separating
them from the power of which they are ambitious.</p>

<p>And among all the images which the sacred soil
suggested to my soul, this image of the king was the
most vivid. Sometimes he almost seemed to me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
created form; and I used to gaze on him eagerly,
while sudden ideas of indescribable beauty flashed
across my intellect and faded away, never perhaps to
appear again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus the Roman Campagna with its severe teaching
strengthened me to follow out the perfection of
my manhood, to assert my inward sovereignty, to
trace with a firm hand that “line of circumference
from which human beauty is generated,” according to
Leonardo’s saying. And at the close of each day
I asked myself: “By what new thoughts has my
treasure been enriched? What new energies have
been developed from my being? What new possibilities
have I caught sight of?” And I wished that
every day should bear the impress of my style,
should be distinguished by some sign of vigorous art,
by some proud emblem of victory. My familiarity
with Thucydides set before me the example of those
strategists of his, who are constantly making fine, pithy
harangues to their soldiers, then fighting with all their
might, and finally raising a trophy on the field.</p>

<p><i>Cui bono?</i>&mdash;was the cry which came from far and
wide out of the mouths of a twilight crowd with
voices not unlike eunuchs’.&mdash;What is the meaning,
what is the value of life? Why live? Why strive?
All efforts are useless, all is vanity and sorrow. We
ought to kill off our passions one after another, and
then extirpate to the very roots the hope and desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
which are the cause of life. Renunciation, complete
unconsciousness, the vanishing away of dreams,
absolute annihilation&mdash;that is the final liberation.</p>

<p>They were a miserable race stricken with leprosy
reiterating their dreary complaint. The ancient
Persians, as the ever-fresh Herodotus narrates, used
to attribute this foul infirmity to offences committed
<em>against the Sun</em>. And these slavish people had
indeed offended against the Sun.</p>

<p>A certain number of them, hoping to be cleansed,
had bathed in great fonts of piety, where they softened
and anointed themselves with great contrition. But
the sight of these was quite as repugnant.</p>

<p>I turned away my eyes and ears elsewhere; and
my heart-strings throbbed with proud joy, because
my eyes were undimmed by tears, and could
perceive all lines and all colours, because my
healthy, watchful ears could hear all sounds and all
rhythms, because my spirit could rejoice boundlessly
in fugitive appearances and know how to cultivate
within itself very different forms of melancholy, how
to find the sweetest value of life in the rapidity of its
metamorphoses and in the denseness of its mysteries.
“Oh manifold Beauty of the World,” I used then to
pray, “not to thee alone do my praises ascend; not
to thee alone, but also to my forefathers, to those also
who, remote ages ago, understood how to enjoy thee,
and transmitted their fervid and rich blood to me.
Praised be they now and for ever, for the beautiful
wounds which they inflicted, for the beautiful fires
they kindled, for the beautiful goblets they emptied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
for the beautiful garments which clothed them,
for the beautiful palfreys they caressed, for the
beautiful women they enjoyed, for all their slaughter,
their intoxication, their magnificence, their luxury,
let them be praised; because thus did they form in
me those senses in which thou canst widely and
deeply reflect thyself, oh Beauty of the World, as in
five wide and deep seas!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime, the poets, discouraged and
erring, having exhausted their store of rhymes in
evoking images of other days, in weeping over their
own dead illusions, and in counting the colours of
the dying leaves, were asking, some ironically, some
seriously: “What can be our function now? Are we
to exalt universal suffrage in senile rhymes? Are
we to hasten with the breathlessness of hexameters
the fall of the king, the advent of republics, the accession
of the people to power? Is there no demagogue
Cleophontes who manufactures <em>lire</em> in Rome, as in
Athens of old? For a modest sum we might persuade
the incredulous, on his very instruments tuned
by himself, that power, right, thought, wisdom, light,
are to be found in the masses....”</p>

<p>But not one among them, more generous and
more eager than the rest, arose to answer: “Defend
Beauty! That is your only function. Defend
the vision that is within you. Since mortals have
now ceased to bear honour and reverence to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
singer scholars of the Muse that favours them, as
Odysseus said, defend yourselves with all your
weapons, even with jests, if such are of more use
than invectives. Be careful to sharpen the point of
your scorn with the bitterest poison. Let your
sarcasm have such corrosive strength that it may
reach to the very marrow and destroy it. Brand to
the very bone the stupid brows of those who would
put an exact mark on each soul, as on a household
utensil, and would make human heads alike as the
heads of nails under the blow of the hammer. Let
your frenzied laughter rise to the very heaven, when
you hear the stablemen of the Great Beast vociferating
in the Assembly. For the sake of the glory of
Mind proclaim and demonstrate that their sayings
are not less ignoble than the groans of the flatulent
peasant. Proclaim and demonstrate that their hands&mdash;to
which your father Dante would give the
same epithet as he gave to the nails of Thais&mdash;may
be fit to gather manure, but are not worthy of
being raised to sanction a law in the Assembly.
Defend the Thought which they threaten, the Beauty
which they outrage! A day will come when they
will attempt to burn the books, shatter the statues,
rip up the canvases. Defend the ancient generous
work of your masters and the future work of your
disciples against the rage of these drunken slaves.
Do not despair because ye are few. Ye possess
the supreme knowledge and the supreme power of
the world&mdash;the Word. Words may have more
murderous power than a chemical formula. Oppose
destruction resolutely with destruction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>And the patricians, stripped of their authority in
the name of equality, and looked upon as ghosts
from a world which has disappeared for ever; unfaithful,
the greater part of them at least, to their lineage,
and ignorant or forgetful of the art of mastery professed
by their forefathers, were also asking: “What
can be our function now? Are we to deceive the
age and ourselves by attempting to revive some
slender hope among faded memories of the past,
under those vaulted roofs storied with sanguine mythology,
which are too vast for our restricted breathing?
Or must we recognise the great dogma of Eighty-nine,
and open the porticoes of our courts to popular
applause, illuminate our travertine balconies for State
festivals, associate with Jewish bankers, exercise our
small share of sovereignty by filling up the voting
ticket with the names of men of the middle classes,
of our tailors, our hatters, our bootmakers, our
money-lenders, and our lawyers?”</p>

<p>A few among them&mdash;ill-inclined for peaceful
renunciation, elegant boredom, and barren irony&mdash;answered:
“Train yourselves as you train your race-horses,
and wait for the opportunity. Learn the
method of asserting yourselves and strengthening
your own persons, as you have learned that of winning
on the turf. By strength of will force all your
energies, even your stormiest passions and darkest
vices, into a straight line and towards a definite aim.
Be assured that the essence of personality far exceeds
all accessory attributes in value, and that inward
sovereignty is the chief mark of the aristocrat. Believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
only in force tempered by long discipline. Force
is the first law of nature; it is indestructible, not to be
abolished. Discipline is the supreme virtue of the
freeman. The world can be based only on force, as
truly in civilised ages as in the epochs of barbarism.
If all the races of the earth were destroyed by
another deluge, and new generations were to arise
from the stones, as in the old fable, men would begin
to fight amongst themselves as soon as they had
issued from their mother earth, until one of them
the strongest, should succeed in mastering the others.
Wait, therefore, and prepare for your opportunity.
Fortunately, the State built on foundations of popular
suffrage and equality, cemented by fear, is not only
an ignoble, but also a precarious structure. The
State ought to be nothing less than an institution
perfectly adapted to promote the gradual elevation
of a privileged class towards an ideal form of existence.
Therefore, upon the economic and political
equality to which democracy aspires, you must go
on forming a new oligarchy, a new realm of force;
and before long, sooner or later, you will succeed in
taking the reins into your own hands again, so as to
rule the multitude for your own profit. Indeed, you
will have little difficulty in bringing back the common
herd to its obedience. The masses always remain
slaves; they have a natural impulse to stretch out
their wrists to the fetters. The sense of liberty will
never to the end of time exist in them. Do not be
deceived by their vociferations and their hideous
contortions; but always remember that the soul of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the Multitude is in the power of Panic. It will be
your policy, therefore, when the opportunity comes,
to provide yourselves with cutting whips, to assume
an imperious mien, to plan some humorous stratagem.
When the cunning Ulysses was ranging the
field to call in every one to the council, if he came
across a noisy plebeian, he used to chastise him
with his sceptre, scolding him thus: 'Silence, silence,
coward, pusillanimous one, thing of naught in the
council.’ The noble demagogue Alcibiades, who
was more versed than any in the government of the
Great Beast, began one of his orations on the expedition
into Sicily thus: 'This command, oh Athenians&mdash;this
command belongs to me rather than to any
one else, and I hold myself worthy of this command.’
But truly there is no teaching more profound and
more suitable for you than that given by Herodotus
in the beginning of the book of Melpomene. Here
it is: 'The Scythians, having spent twenty-eight
years away from their own country in ruling over
Upper Asia, and desirous, after such a long interval,
to return home, found that to do so involved hardships
no less great than those they had suffered in
the Median war. A great and hostile army barred
their entrance. And this came to pass because the
Scythian women, having been left so long without
men of their own race, had given themselves to their
slaves. And from the slaves and the women had
sprung a generation of young men who, conscious of
their origin, had set themselves against those who
were returning from Media; and in order to hold the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
pass, had first of all made an entrenchment stretching
from the mountains of Taurus to the Mæotian
marsh, which is very wide. They then proceeded to
repulse the attempted assault of the Scythians, defending
themselves with many deeds of valour; and
as, after various conflicts, the Scythians found they
could make no advance by fighting, one of them
began to speak thus: Oh Scythians, why do we
labour thus? By fighting against our slaves we
weaken ourselves by the number of our deaths, and
by killing them we only reduce the number of our
future subjects. Wherefore it seems to me fitting
that we should put aside our spears and darts, and
that each of us should be armed only with his horsewhip,
and thus we should confront these slaves.
Because up till now, seeing us march against them
in arms, they have no doubt thought themselves our
equals, and sons of equals; but when they see us
coming against them wielding whips instead of arms,
they will feel at once that they are our slaves, and
they will not dare to resist us any longer. The
Scythians followed this advice; and their adversaries,
thunderstruck by the change, ceased fighting and
took to flight. Thus did the Scythians win back
their country.’ Oh ye masters without mastery,
think upon it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps in my busy solitude&mdash;although I feared
neither sickness, nor madness, nor death, having
within me that tutelary flame of pride, of thought,
and of faith&mdash;perhaps there lay hidden beneath my
melancholy a real need for communion with some
kindred spirit as yet unknown, or with some circle
of minds disposed to care sincerely and passionately
for those things for which I so passionately cared.
It seemed to me that this need was betrayed by a
mental habit I had of casting my theory of ideas
and images into a concrete oratorical or lyrical form,
almost as if for an imaginary audience. Warm bursts
of eloquence and poetry would suddenly flood my
being, and silence was at times a burden to my overflowing
soul.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>Then, to comfort my solitude, I thought of giving
corporeal form to that <em>dæmon</em> in whom, according
to my first master’s teaching, I believed as the infallible
pledge which was to lead me to achieve the
integrity of my moral being. I thought of committing
to a noble, masterful mouth, red with the same
blood as mine, the duty of repeating to me, “Oh
thou, be what thou oughtest to be.”</p>
</div>

<p>Among the figures of my ancestors one above all
others is most dear to me, and sacred as a votive
image. He is the noblest and the most brilliant
flower of my race, represented by the brush of
a divine artist. It is the portrait of Alessandro
Cantelmo, Count of Volturara, painted by Da Vinci
between the years 1493 and 1494, at Milan, where
Alessandro, attracted by the unheard-of magnificence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
of that Sforza who wished to turn the Lombard city
into a <em>New Athens</em>, had taken up his abode with a
company of men-at-arms.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the world that I prize so much,
nor was treasure ever guarded with more passionate
jealousy. I am never weary of thanking fortune for
having caused such a noble figure to brighten my
life, and for having granted me the incomparable
luxury of such a secret. “If thou possess a beautiful
object, remember that every glance cast on it by
another is a usurpation of thy possession. The joy
of possession is diminished when it is divided, therefore
do thou refuse to share it. They say that some
one declined to enter a public museum lest his glance
should be mingled with that of strangers. Now, if
thou do indeed possess a beautiful object, enclose
it within seven doors, and cover it with seven veils.”
And a veil hangs over the magnetic face; but the
dream in it is so profound, the fire in it is so powerful,
that at times the woven stuff trembles with the
vehemence of the breathing.</p>

<p>And so I gave my <em>dæmon</em> the form of this
familiar genius, and in my solitude I felt him alive
with a life far more intense than my own. Had I
not before me by means of the lasting miracle of
one of the world’s greatest revealers&mdash;had I not
before me an heroic spirit, sprung from my own
stock, and constituted of all the distinctive characteristics
of that lineage which I was so eagerly striving
to manifest in myself, and which in him appeared in
such fierce relief as to be almost terrible?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>There he is still before me, always the same, yet
always new! Such a body is not the prison of the
soul, but its faithful semblance. All the lines of the
beardless face are as precise and firm as those of a
deeply-chiselled bronze; the dark pallor of the skin
conceals tough muscles, wont in moments of anger
and desire to stand out clearly with a fierce tremor;
the straight, rigid nose, the bony, narrow chin, the
curved but energetically-locked lips express the boldness
of the will; and his glance is like the flash of a
beautiful sword coming from beneath the shadow
of thick and heavy hair, violet-black in hue like the
bunches of grapes on a branch in the burning sun.
He stands immovable, visible from the knees upwards;
but the imagination pictures at once how the
strong, flexible legs will start when the enemy appears,
giving a formidable impetus to the beautiful frame.
“<em>Cave, adsum</em>”&mdash;well does the old device apply to
him. He is dressed in very light armour, evidently
inlaid by a most accomplished workman, and his
hands are bare; pale, sensitive hands, yet with
something tyrannical, almost homicidal, about their
clear outlines: the left hand is resting on the Gorgon’s
head on his sword-hilt, the right on the corner of a
table covered with dark velvet, of which a fold is
visible. Lying on the table beside the gauntlets and
helmet are a statuette of Pallas and a pomegranate,
whose pointed leaf and brilliant flower are growing
on the same stalk as the fruit. Through the opening
of a window behind his head is seen a bare landscape
ending in a group of hills, over which rises a peak,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
standing solitary as a proud thought; and on a scroll
beneath is this verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Frons viridis ramo antiquo et flos igneus uno tempore
(prodigium) fructus et uber inest.”</p>
</div>

<p>Where and by what chance did Alessandro first
meet with the Florentine master, who was at
that time attaining the supreme splendour of his
manhood? Perhaps at one of Ludovico’s feasts,
full of the marvels created by the occult arts of
the Magician? Or perhaps rather at the palace
of Cecilia Gallerani, where military men discussed
the science of war, musicians sang, architects and
painters drew, philosophers argued about natural
science, and poets recited compositions of their own
and of others “in the presence of this heroine,” as
Bandello relates. It is here that I like to imagine
their first meeting, about the time when the favourite
of the Moor was already beginning to love Alessandro
secretly.</p>

<p>What a fire of audacious intelligence and of
masterful will must have been apparent in the youth,
for Leonardo to be so taken with him from that very
day! Perhaps Alessandro discussed with him, apart
from the others, “the methods of destroying any
rock or fortress not founded on stone,” and grew
eager to know the formidable secrets of this fascinating
creator of Madonnas, who surpassed all masters
and makers of instruments of war in the novelty of
his ideas. Perhaps in the course of the argument
Leonardo may have uttered one of those deep sayings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
of his about the art of life; and looking into the
eyes of the youth on whom silence had fallen, recognised
in him a spirit determined to take everything
that can be got out of life, an ambitious man disposed,
instead of following his fate blindly, to
attain the mastery for himself with the help of that
science which multiplies the energies of him who
possesses it and concentrates them on the attainment
of his aim. And perhaps the man who was a few
years later to become Cæsar Borgia’s military architect,
who was invoking and waiting for some magnanimous
prince to offer him unlimited means of
carrying out his innumerable designs, may have perceived
in this curly-headed patrician the future
founder of a royal dynasty, and loved him and
placed his proudest hopes in him.</p>

<p>I like to think that a brief entry in the commentaries
of Da Vinci (who was then busy with studies
for the equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza)
refers to the evening of this first meeting: “The
penultimate day of April 1492. Messer Alessandro
Cantelmo’s fine jennet: has a good neck and a very
beautiful head.”</p>

<p>After leaving Cecilia’s palace together, they both
paused for awhile in the street, still arguing; and
when Leonardo noticed the jennet, he went up to
look at it. As he stroked the beautiful neck, some
involuntary expression escaped him regarding the
terrible labour his insatiable spirit underwent in
researches for the monument which the Moor desired
to erect in honour of the fame of his father, the conqueror<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
of the duchy and the vanquisher of Genoa.
With a wide sweep the creative hand of the artist
traced the outline of the Colossus in the air, making
it visible to the youth’s inner vision. The day was
sinking; the hour of spring twilight was trembling
on the pinnacles of the glorious city; a company of
musicians passed by singing; and the horse neighed
with impatience. Then the soul of Alessandro
swelled with an heroic sentiment which made him
seem like a phantom of the great captain. “Ah, to
set out on my conquests!” he thought, as he vaulted
into the saddle. And then seeing that in reality he
was only setting out on some common affair of daily
life, he said suddenly, with a bitter impulse: “Seemeth
it to you, Master Leonardo, that life can be of any
worth to a man of my station?” And Leonardo,
who did not marvel at these unexpected words: “It
is everything that the eagle should take his first
flight.” And perhaps the beardless horseman riding
away among his men-at-arms may have seemed to
him destined to be a king, “like him who in the bee-hive
is born leader of the bees.”</p>

<p>The following morning a servant brought the
jennet to the sculptor as a gift, with compliments
from his master.</p>

<p>Thus do I imagine the beginning of their mutual
liberality. The master rewarded his disciple with
the true riches, since “that cannot be called riches
which it is possible to lose.” Like Socrates, he
preferred to have for his disciples those who
had beautiful hair and were richly clothed. Like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Socrates, he excelled in the art of elevating the
human soul to its supreme degree of vigour. Certainly
Alessandro was for a time the chosen one
in that <em>Academia Leonardo Vincii</em>, where a noble
spiritual lineage was developed little by little under
teaching which drew its warmth from the central
truth as from a sun which cannot be darkened.
“Nothing can be loved or hated, unless first there be
knowledge of that thing. The love of anything is
child to the knowledge of it. The more certain the
knowledge, the more fervent the love.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here and there in Leonardo’s interrupted memoirs
one comes across signs of the passionate curiosity
with which the indefatigable experimentalist used to
watch over the precious soul of his young friend.
He had no secrets from him, for he desired to contribute
by all the means in his power towards
increasing the accumulated forces of his soul so as to
render its future action in a wider field more efficacious.
He noted down for remembrance: “Speak to
Volturara about a certain way of shooting a dart.”
And again: “Show Volturara ways of raising and
letting down bridges, ways of burning and destroying
those of the enemy, and the ways of placing mortar
pieces by day and by night.” Or: “Messer Alessandro
wishes to give me Valturio’s <em>De re militari</em>,
and the <em>Décades</em>, and Lucretius’ <em>Delle cose naturali</em>.”</p>

<p>He used to be struck by the terse, proud sayings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
of the young man, and noted down some of them:
“Messer Alessandro says one must grasp fortune
firmly from the front, since behind she is bald.”
And again: “As I was working at the book on
dividing rivers into numerous branches, and making
them fordable, Volturara said boldly: Truly, Cyrus
son of Cambyses understood all that when he
chastised a river in that very way for carrying away
a white horse of his.”</p>

<p>One day&mdash;so I imagine&mdash;they had both been
invited to the magnificent house of Cecilia Gallerani;
and Leonardo had transported the souls of all
present by his performance on a new lyre of his
own manufacture, made almost entirely of silver, in
the shape of a horse’s skull. During the pause which
followed the applause, the second Sappho ordered a
beautiful little casket, richly inlaid with enamel and
gems, the Duke’s gift, to be brought to her; and
she showed it to those present, and asked them what
object was, in their opinion, sufficiently precious to
deserve to be kept in it. Every one expressed a
different opinion. “And you, Messer Alessandro?”
asked Madonna Cecilia, with a soft glance. And he
replied audaciously: “Alexander of old chose the
most precious casket among all the treasures of
Darius, that which was richer than aught that eyes
had ever beheld, as a shrine for Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>.”</p>

<p>Da Vinci immediately noted down this answer in
his memoirs, and added: “One can see that he feeds
on the marrow and nerves of lions.”</p>

<p>Another day they had both been invited by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
same hostess to her garden; and Alessandro, after an
argument with some of those “famous spirits,” drew
apart, to follow out some new thought which the heat
of the discussion had generated in that pregnant
intellect. The beautiful Bergamese Countess called
him several times, but it was long ere he turned
round, for it was long ere he heard the call. Met by
a gracious reproof, or perhaps a stinging remark, he
answered, smiling: “He who is fixed to a star does
not look round.”</p>

<p>In the evening Da Vinci noted down this answer
also in his memoirs, and to it added his prophecy:
“Soon he will take his first flight, fill the universe
with wonder, fill all writings with his renown, and
confer eternal glory on the place of his birth.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was that very evening, as he meditated
on the intensity and versatility of that youthful
temperament, that his mind, ever inclined to the
mysterious significations of emblems and allegories,
hit upon that beautiful symbol of the pomegranate,
including and bearing upon one stalk the fruit, the
pointed leaf, and the flaming flower.</p>

<p>But on the 9th of July in the year 1495, three
days after the battle of Fornovo, he noted down:
“Volturara died on the field, as was meet for one like
him. Never did blind steel cut off a brighter hope
for the world.”</p>

<p>Thus lived and died the young hero in whom the
purest essence of my warlike race had seemed to be
concentrated. Thus fully was he revealed to me in
the faithful likeness handed down to his distant heir
by an artist who might be called Prometheus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“O thou,” he seemed to say to me, as with his
magnetic glance he took possession of my soul, “be
what thou oughtest to be.”</p>

<p>“For thy sake,” I used to say to him, “for thy sake
I will be what I ought to be; because I love thee, O
brilliant flower of my race; because I desire to place
all my pride in obeying thy law, O master. Thou
didst bear within thyself strength sufficient to subjugate
the earth, but thy royal destiny was not to be
fulfilled in the age wherein thou didst first appear.
In that age thou wast but the herald and forerunner
of thyself, for thou wast destined to reappear higher up
thy ancient stem in the maturity of future ages, on
the threshold of a world not explored by the warriors,
but promised by the wise men: to reappear as the
messenger, the interpreter, and the lord of a new life.
Therefore didst thou suddenly disappear like a demi-god
by the banks of a swollen river, amid the roar of
battle and storm, just as the sun was entering the
sign of the Lion. Death did not cut off thy great
promise, but fate willed to alter its marvellous fulfilment.
Thy virtue, which could not then be manifested
to the earth by triumphant actions, must
necessarily revive some day in thy still surviving
lineage. And may it be to-morrow! May thy equal
be begotten by me! I invoke and await and prepare
the renewal of thy genius with unfailing faith, the
while adoring thy living image, O conqueror and
sage, thou who didst lay the blade of thy beautiful
naked sword as a mark in the books of wisdom.”</p>

<p>Thus I used to address him. And under his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
glance and inspired by him, not only were my actual
energies multiplied, but my task lay clear before me
in definite outlines. “Thou, therefore, shalt labour to
carry out thy own destiny and that of thy race.
Thou shalt have before thy eyes at the same time
the premeditated plan of thy existence and the
vision of an existence superior to thine own. Thou
shalt live in the idea that each life being the sumtotal
of past lives is the condition of future lives.
Thou shalt not, therefore, look upon thyself only as
the beginning, aim, and end of thy own destiny, but
thou shalt feel the whole value and the whole weight
of the inheritance received from thy ancestors, which
thou must transmit to thy descendant countersigned
with the stamp of thy most vigorous characteristics.
Let the supreme conception of thy dignity be
founded on the certainty, so sure in thee, that
thou art the preserving link of a multifold energy
which to-morrow, or after the lapse of a century,
or at some indefinite time, may reassert itself in
a sublime manifestation. But hope that it may
be to-morrow! Triple, therefore, is thy task, for
thou dost possess the gift of poetry, and must
study to acquire the science of words. Triple is
thy task:&mdash;by direct methods to conduct thy being
to attain the perfect integrity of the Latin type; to
concentrate the purest essence of thy spirit, and to
reproduce in a single and supreme work of art thy
deepest vision of the universe; to preserve the ideal
riches of thy race and thine own individual conquests
in a son, who, under paternal instruction, shall recognise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
and co-ordinate them in himself, and shall thus
feel worthy of aspiring to the realisation of ever
higher possibilities.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then, with the tables of my laws thus clearly set
before me, there came over me not only the sadness
of doubt, but an anxiety akin to fear&mdash;a new and
horrible anxiety. “If some blind, unforeseen violence
from exterior forces were to shake, or deform, or crush
my work! If I should have to bend and submit to
some brutal injury of chance. If one of those destructive
gusts which burst suddenly out of the darkness
should cause the fall of my edifice before its
completion.” This fear came over me during a
strange hour of agitation and depression, and I felt
my faith failing me. But soon after I felt ashamed
when my monitor said to me: “Judging from the
quality of thy thoughts, thou seemest to me like one
contaminated by the crowd, or in the power of a
woman. See, even passing through the crowd which
was gazing at thee has lessened thee in thine own
eyes. Seest thou not that those men who frequent
it become unfruitful as mules? The gaze of the
crowd is worse than a splash of mud; the breath of
it is poisonous. Go afar off while the sewer discharges
itself. Go afar off and ponder on that which
thou hast gathered up. Thy hour will come. What
fearest thou? Of what worth would be all this
discipline, did it not make thee stronger than circumstances?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Even by this it is sometimes possible to
create by force of will. Therefore go afar off while
the sewer discharges itself. Delay not; let not thyself
be contaminated by the crowd, or fall into the
power of a woman. It is true thou wilt have to form
an alliance in order to accomplish one part of the
task thou hast assigned to thyself. But better is it
for thee to wait and remain alone; better even to
slay thy hope than to submit body and spirit to
unworthy fetters. If the thing loved is contemptible,
the lover is contemptible. Thou must never forget
this saying of thy Leonardo, that, like Castruccio,
thou mayest always be able proudly to reply: 'I
have chosen her; she did not choose me.’”</p>

<p>Justly did this admonition come to me at that
time. And without delay I made ready to depart
from the tainted city.</p>

<p>It was a time when the active zeal of destroyers
and builders was raging feverishly over the soil of
Rome. With the clouds of dust a species of madness
for lucre seemed to spread like a poisonous whirlwind,
taking hold not only of the men of the labouring
classes, the familiar spirits of lime and bricks, but
also of the proudest heirs of papal families, who till
then had looked scornfully at all intruders from the
windows of travertine palaces, which stood obdurately
firm under the crust of ages. One by one these magnificent
families&mdash;founded, carried on, strengthened
by nepotism and civil wars&mdash;sank lower, slid down
into the new mire, went under and disappeared.
Famous fortunes accumulated by centuries of successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
rapine and Mæcenatic luxury were exposed
to the risks of the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>The laurels and roses of the Villa Sciarra, whose
praises had been sung by the nightingales for such a
long succession of nights, were being cut down to
the ground, or survived in a humble position inside
the gates of little gardens surrounding new villas
built for grocers. The gigantic Ludovisi cypresses,
those of the Aurora, the very same which had once
spread the solemnity of their ancient mystery over
the Olympian head of Goethe, lay on the ground (I
see them always in imagination as my eyes saw them
one November afternoon) side by side in a row, with
the smoke from their naked roots rising up to the
pale heaven above, with their black roots all laid
bare, and seeming still to hold prisoner within their
vast intricacies the phantom of omnipotent life. And
those lordly meadows all round, where only one spring
ago violets more numerous than the blades of grass
were springing up for the last time, were now ghastly
with white lime-pits, red heaps of bricks, the creaking
of cart-wheels loaded with stones; while the shouts of
the master builders alternated with the hoarse cries
of the carters, and the brutal work which was to
occupy places so long sacred to Beauty and Visions
went on rapidly.</p>

<p>It seemed as though a blast of barbarism were
blowing over Rome, and threatening to tear away
that radiant crown of patrician villas, incomparable
in the world of memories and poetry. The menace
of the barbarians hung over the very box-trees of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Villa Albani, though they had seemed as immortal
as the Caryatids and the solitude.</p>

<p>The contagion was spreading rapidly everywhere.
In the midst of the incessant current of business, of
the ferocious fury of appetites and passions, of the
disordered and exclusive exercise of utilitarian
activity, all sense of decorum had been lost, all
respect for the Past laid aside. The battle for gain
was being fought with unbridled, implacable violence.
The arms used were the pickaxe, the trowel, and
bad faith. And from week to week, with almost
chimerical rapidity, enormous empty cages, pierced
with rectangular holes, their artificial cornices coated
with shameful stucco, were rising on foundations
filled with heaps of ruins. A species of huge whitish
tumour was rising out of the side of the ancient city
and sucking away its life.</p>

<p>And then day after day at sunset&mdash;as the quarrelsome
bands of workmen were dispersing to fill the
taverns of the Via Salaria and Via Nomentana&mdash;down
the princely avenues of the Villa Borghese they
drove in shining carriages, these new favourites of
fortune, the stamp of whose ignoble origin neither
hairdresser, nor tailor, nor bootmaker had been able
to remove. One saw them passing to and fro, to the
resounding trot of their bay or their black horses,
easily recognisable by the insolent awkwardness of
their attitudes, the embarrassed look of their rapacious
hands imprisoned in gloves always either too large or
too small for them. And they seemed to be saying:
“We are the new masters of Rome. Bow down to us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>Such, indeed, were the masters of that Rome which
seers and prophets, drunk with the burning fumes
of all the Latin blood that has been shed, have
compared to the bow of Ulysses&mdash;“One must bend
it or die.” But these very seers, who for so long had
shone as stars in the heroic heaven of their country,
before her liberation, had now become “sordid charcoal,
only fit to trace an ugly figure or an unseemly
word upon the wall,” according to the atrocious simile
of an indignant rhetorician. They, too, gave themselves
up to selling and bartering, to legal quibbling
and setting of snares, and no one alluded any more
to the destroying bow. And there seemed in truth
no prospect of the cry suddenly arising to terrify
them: “O suitors, devourers of other men’s substance,
beware! Ulysses is at hand in Ithaca!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The best thing to do was to withdraw from the
scene for a while. And I left with my horses and my
household gods without taking farewell of anybody.</p>

<p>For my dwelling-place I had chosen Rebursa, my
favourite among my hereditary estates, as it had been
my father’s favourite before me; it was a suitable
retreat for a healthy soul, a country with a rocky
backbone, peculiarly sober in outline and vigorous in
style; fit to welcome and nurse the lordly dream of
my ambition, as it had welcomed and nursed my
father’s lofty melancholy after the fall of his king, and
the death of him who, when living, had seemed to be
the light of our house, our surest possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>Besides, not far from there&mdash;at Trigento&mdash;I had
friends, not forgotten although not seen for many
years, friends to whom I was bound by grateful
memories of childhood and youth. And the thought
of seeing them again cheered my spirit.</p>

<p>At Trigento, in the old baronial palace, surrounded
by a garden almost as vast as a park, lived the Capea
Montaga, one of the most illustrious and magnificent
families in the two Sicilies, a family ruined by ten
years’ devotion to the fortunes of their exiled king,
and obliged now to live a retired life on the only
estate left to them, in the heart of the silent province.
The old Prince of Castromitrano&mdash;who had
enjoyed the highest honours at the Courts of Ferdinand
and Francis, and who had faithfully followed
the exile to Rome and across the Alps without ever
renouncing the pomp of happier times&mdash;had been
dreaming in the shade for years, and for years waiting
in vain for the Restoration; he was now sinking
into the grave with premature old age, while his
children were fading away in the lifeless monotony
of their existence. The madness of the Princess
Aldoina alone disturbed this long agony by throwing
over it gleams of the fantastic splendour of the Past.
And nothing could equal the desolation of the contrast
between the miserable reality and the pompous
phantoms which issued from the brain of the mad
woman.</p>

<p>This great and dying race added a kind of funereal
beauty to the rocky country for my soul, which was
already seeking to absorb all the soul enclosed within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
that stony cloister. Already a mysterious presentiment
had arisen from the depths of my being that
my destiny was approaching and mingling with that
lonely destiny. And the names of the three maiden
princesses resounded in my memory with a faint
magical music: Massimilla, Anatolia, Violante&mdash;names
in which there seemed to me to be something
vaguely visible, like a pale portrait behind a clouded
glass; names expressive as faces full of light and
shade, in which an infinity of grace, passion, and
sorrow was already apparent to me.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“<em>Grandissima grazia d’ombre e di lumi s’aggiunge ai visi di quelli che<br />
seggono sulle porte di quelle abitazioni che sono oscure....</em>”</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Leonardo da Vinci.</span></p>

<p class="p2">I was sincerely glad when I recognised on the road
to Rebursa, Oddo and Antonello Montaga, who had
found out the hour of my arrival and had come to
meet me. Both of them embraced me with effusion,
delivered messages of welcome from Trigento, and
asked me a thousand questions at the same moment;
they seemed delighted to see me, and still more
delighted when I spoke of my intention of remaining
some time in the country.</p>

<p>“You are going to stay with us!” exclaimed
Antonello, as he pressed my hand almost beside himself
with joy. “Then you are sent by God....”
“You must come this very day to Trigento,” said
Oddo, interrupting his brother. “They are all expecting
you there. You must come to-day....”</p>

<p>They both seemed to me overcome by a strange,
almost feverish agitation; their gestures were wild
and convulsive, their speech rapid and anxious; they
were like two feeble prisoners just set free from an
imprisonment which seems like a terrible dream,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
whom the first contact with outward life has disturbed
and confused, making them almost dizzy. The more
I looked at them, the more clearly I noticed these
strange signs about their persons; and I began to
feel anxious and distressed about them.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I replied, “I don’t know if I can
come to-day. I am weary after so many hours of
travelling. But to-morrow....”</p>

<p>I felt a vague desire to be alone, to collect myself,
to taste the quality of the strange melancholy that
had suddenly fallen upon me. A flood of memories
rolled towards me from the things around, and the
presence of those two unfortunate beings prevented
my receiving it.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Oddo, “you will come to luncheon
with us to-morrow. Do you consent?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will come.”</p>

<p>“You cannot imagine how eagerly they are expecting
you over there.”</p>

<p>“Then you had not forgotten me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! It is you who had forgotten us.”</p>

<p>“You had forgotten us,” repeated Antonello with a
somewhat distorted smile. “You were right. We
are buried.”</p>

<p>The tone of his voice struck me more than his
words. His tones, gestures, looks, and all his actions
had a singular intensity, like those of a man stricken
by a mysterious disease or tormented by a continual
hallucination, living in the midst of apparitions
invisible to the eyes of others. It did not escape my
notice that he was making an effort to break through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
some atmosphere that surrounded him, and to communicate
more directly with me. This effort imparted
a contracted and convulsed look to his whole person.
My anxiety and distress grew greater.</p>

<p>“You will see our house,” he added with the same
smile.</p>

<p>Involuntarily I asked&mdash;</p>

<p>“How is Donna Aldoina?”</p>

<p>Both the brothers hung their heads and did not
answer.</p>

<p>They were like each other; in fact, they were
twins. Both were tall and thin, and a little bent.
They had the same light-coloured eyes, the same
small silky beards, the same pale, restless, nervous
hands, the hands of hysterical subjects. But in
Antonello these marks of weakness and disorder were
deeper and more irreparable. He was doomed.</p>

<p>During the pause that followed, I vainly sought
for words to express myself. I was in bondage to a
kind of melancholy stupor; it seemed as if the whole
weight of my weary body had fallen on my soul.
The road skirted a line of cliffs, and the horses’ trot
as it resounded on the hard ground awoke echoes in
the lonely hollows. At a turn of the road the river
came in sight in the valley, its innumerable windings
shining in the sun. A mass of white ruins was visible,
enclosed like an island within one of these curves.</p>

<p>“Is not that Linturno over there?” I asked, as I
recognised the dead city.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is Linturno,” replied Oddo. “Do you
remember? We once went there together....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“I remember.”</p>

<p>“What a long time ago it is!”</p>

<p>“What a long time!”</p>

<p>“Now there is not much difference between Linturno
and Trigento,” said Antonello, stroking his
beard hesitatingly with slender fingers, while his eyes
seemed to have lost consciousness of outward things.
“You will see to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You are disheartening him!” interrupted Oddo
with some irritation. “He won’t come to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I will come,” I assured them, but I
had to force myself to smile and shake off my
own overpowering melancholy. “I will come, and
shall find some way of cheering you up. You
seem to me a little ill from loneliness, a little
depressed.”</p>

<p>Antonello, who was sitting opposite me, laid his
hand on my knee and leant forward to look into my
eyes with an indefinable expression of fear and
anxiety written in his face, as though he had perceived
some terrible meaning in my words, and wished to
question me about it. And once more his white face
close to my own seemed even in the daylight to
belong to a different world, where it existed alone;
and brought to my mind those emaciated, spiritual
faces that stand out from the mysterious backgrounds
of sacred pictures darkened by time and the smoke
of candles.</p>

<p>It was only for a moment. He drew back again
without speaking.</p>

<p>“I have brought my horses with me,” I added, controlling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
my agitation; “we shall go for long rides
every day. You must take exercise and shake off
the idleness and ennui. How do you pass the
hours?”</p>

<p>“In counting them,” said Oddo.</p>

<p>“And your sisters?”</p>

<p>“Oh, poor things!” murmured Oddo with tremulous
tenderness in his voice. “Massimilla prays;
Violante stifles herself with the perfumes sent her
by the Queen; Anatolia&mdash;Anatolia is the one who
keeps us alive, she is our soul, she lives entirely
for us.”</p>

<p>“And the prince?”</p>

<p>“He has aged very much; he is quite white
now.”</p>

<p>“And Don Ottavio?”</p>

<p>“He hardly ever leaves his rooms. We have
almost forgotten the sound of his voice.”</p>

<p>“And Donna Aldoina?” I was just going to ask
again, but I restrained myself and was silent.</p>

<p>We were now in the undulating valley of the
Saurgo, in a warm hollow. “How early the spring
is here!” I exclaimed, with a desire to console
these wretched beings and myself as well. “In
February the first flowers come out. Is not that in
itself a privilege? You do not know how to enjoy
the things life offers you. You convert a garden into
a prison and torture yourselves within it.”</p>

<p>“Where are the flowers?” asked Antonello with his
painful smile.</p>

<p>We all three began to look out for flowers. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
ground was tawny and rugged as a lion’s skin; it
seemed made to nourish this dry and harassed but in
reality fruitful vegetation. “There they are!” I cried
with a keen feeling of pleasure, as I pointed out a row
of almond trees on a long billowy-looking mound.</p>

<p>“They are on your property,” said Oddo.</p>

<p>We had indeed reached the neighbourhood of
Rebursa. The rocky chain of hills with its broken
outlines and sharp peaks, and the winding Saurgo
lapping at its foot, stretched out on the right, and
rose step by step up to the highest summit, Mount
Corace, which glittered in the sun like a helmet. To
the left of the road the ground sloped away in undulations,
like a wide stretch of sandy shore, and further
away it rose into brown lumpy hills like the humps
of camels in the desert.</p>

<p>“Look! look! There are some more up there!”
I cried as I noticed another pale silvery cloud of
blossom. “Don’t you see, Antonello?”</p>

<p>He looked less at the almond blossom than at me,
a timorous smile of amazement hovering on his lips,
wondering perhaps at the childish joy which the
sight of the early flowers had awaked in me. “But
what fairer welcome could the land beloved of my
father have given me? What brighter festal decorations
could this hardy country with its backbone of
rock have worn?”</p>

<p>“If Anatolia, Violante, and Massimilla were only
here!” exclaimed Oddo, who began to share my
unexpected enthusiasm. “Ah, if they were only
here!” and regret was expressed in his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“We must bring them here among the flowers,”
said Antonello softly.</p>

<p>“See what a quantity!” I continued, giving myself
up to the novel pleasure with the more confidence
that I felt able to transfer some share of it to these
poor pent-up souls. “I am glad they belong to
me, Oddo.”</p>

<p>“We must bring them here among the flowers,”
repeated Antonello softly, as if in a dream.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that his feverish eyes were refreshed
by the sight of these pure blossoms, and that in
his gentle words they were fused with the vague
outlines of his three sisters: “Massimilla prays;
Violante stifles herself with perfumes; Anatolia is
our life and soul.”</p>

<p>“Stop!” I rose and said to the coachman, for a
sudden idea had struck me, and filled me with singular
delight. “Let us get out; let us go into the fields.
I want you to carry home some branches. It will be
a treat for them down there.”</p>

<p>Oddo and Antonello looked at each other with
rather a puzzled air, half smiling, half shy, as if the
idea were something unforeseen and strange which
at once scared them and gave them a delicious
sensation. They had shown me their malady,
they had revealed to me their sorrow, they had
spoken to me of the gloomy prison from which
they had come, and were now about to enter again;
and here was I, on the high road, asking them to
acknowledge and celebrate the feast of spring: of
that spring which they had forgotten, and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
they appeared to be seeing for the first time after
long years, gazing on it with mingled fear and joy as
if it were a miracle.</p>

<p>“Let us get out!”</p>

<p>I was tired no longer, for I felt within me the
abundance of life, and that exaltation which spontaneous
acts of generosity give to the spirit. I was
liberal of myself to these two needy souls; I warmed
them at my fire, I slaked their thirst with my wine.
I read in their eyes (and they were continually looking
at me) a kind of submission and faithful surrender.
Already they both belonged to me; so I could exert
my benevolence and my power over them without
fear of failure. “What are you waiting for? Won’t
you get out?” I asked Antonello, who was standing
with his foot on the step, hesitating as if some danger
threatened him.</p>

<p>The contracted smile was still on his face. He
was making a visible effort as he put his foot to the
ground; he staggered as though he had miscalculated
the height, and his first steps were jerky and uncertain.
I helped him up the path. As he felt the
soft earth sink under his footsteps he paused; and
with face turned towards the blossoming trees, he
breathed hard, drank in the beautiful sight with his
pale eyes, and appeared to be almost dazzled.</p>

<p>I touched his arm and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“You didn’t remember these things.”</p>

<p>Oddo, who had already entered the orchard,
exclaimed in a kind of intoxication&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ah! if Violante were only here! This perfume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
is worth far more than the essences sent her by
Maria Sophia.”</p>

<p>Antonello repeated softly&mdash;</p>

<p>“We must bring them here among the flowers.”</p>

<p>It seemed as though the sound of these words had
fascinated his ear from the first, like a musical
cadence. His voice kept the same inflections as he
repeated them. And as I heard the words again I
felt strangely disturbed, almost as if he had addressed
them to me. Again the desire to cut some of the
branches arose within me. It had died out at the
sight of so much living beauty. And vaguely I
pictured to myself the great gift of spring arriving at
the gloomy palace in the twilight.</p>

<p>“Is there no one about?” I asked impatiently. A
peasant came running up. Breathlessly he bent his
head, and began to kiss my hand passionately.</p>

<p>“Cut some of the finest branches,” I ordered him.</p>

<p>He was a magnificent example of his species, a
worthy inhabitant of this rugged flint-strewn land.
He seemed to me like a survivor of Deucalion’s
ancient race, sprung from the pebbles. He brandished
his bill-hook, and with clean, rapid strokes began to
mutilate the joyous vegetable creation. Each stroke
sent down a shower of loose petals, which lay like
snow on the ground.</p>

<p>“Look,” I said to Antonello, showing him a branch;
“did you ever see anything so delicate and so fresh?”</p>

<p>He raised his weak, effeminate hand and touched
a flower with the tips of his fingers. It was the
gesture of the invalid or convalescent, who touches a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
living thing with the dim notion that the contact
will leave some small part of its vitality with him,
just as butterflies leave behind the ephemeral dust of
their wings. He turned to his brother with almost
tender melancholy in his painful smile.</p>

<p>“Do you see, Oddo? We had forgotten, we did
not know ...”</p>

<p>“But don’t you live in a garden?” I asked, marvelling
at the amazement and emotion caused by a
simple branch of almond blossom, as though it were
an unheard-of novelty. “Don’t you pass your whole
time among leaves and flowers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” answered Antonello; “but somehow
I had ceased to notice them. Besides, these are,
or seem to me, <em>quite different</em>. I can’t explain the
impression they make on me. You would not understand.”</p>

<p>The ringing sound of the bill-hook went on, and
he turned towards the almond tree, which was
trembling under the blows. The man was sitting up
in the tree, with the trunk in the grip of his muscular
legs, and above his head, which was dark as a
mulatto’s, hung the fresh silvery cloud, quivering at
the glitter of the hooked steel.</p>

<p>“Tell him to stop,” begged Antonello. “We shall
not be able to carry all those branches.”</p>

<p>“The carriage shall take you to Trigento with your
burden.”</p>

<p>And I lingered on, picturing the arrival of the
springlike gift at the gates of the park where the
three sisters were waiting. Their faces came before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
me indistinctly, yet with some trace of the features
associated with memories of childhood and youth.
And the desire to see them again, to hear their
voices, to recall those memories in their presence, to
know their troubles, and to take part in their unknown
life, grew stronger and stronger within me,
till it began to take the acuteness of anxiety.</p>

<p>Following out my own line of thought and feeling
(the carriage had already begun to roll towards
Rebursa), I said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Long ago the park of Trigento used to be full of
jonquils and violets.”</p>

<p>“So it is still,” said Oddo.</p>

<p>“There were great hedges of box.”</p>

<p>“So there are still.”</p>

<p>“I remember so well the year you came back from
Monaco. Massimilla was very ill. I used to come
over to Trigento nearly every day with my mother ...”</p>

<p>We were immersed in spring. The carriage was
crammed with almond blossom; it was piled behind
our backs and on our knees. Antonello’s white face
looked more wasted than ever in the midst of that
fragrant whiteness, and the melancholy of his feverish
eyes, contrasted with that living expression of youth
eternally renewed, went to my heart.</p>

<p>“What a pity you are not coming to Trigento
to-day!” said Oddo, with deep regret in his voice.
“I don’t like leaving you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” added Antonello. “We have seen
you to-day for the first time after years and years of
silence and oblivion, and now it seems impossible to
do without you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>They spoke these affectionate words with that simplicity
and candour which belong to solitary men,
not accustomed to the affectations of ordinary life.
I felt already that they cared for me and I for them;
that the great gap made by the years was already
bridged over; and that their fate was about to
be bound up irrevocably with mine. Why did my
soul incline so specially towards these two prostrate
beings? why did it yearn with such infinite desire
over graces and sorrows of which it had only caught
a glimpse? why was it so impatient to pour out its
riches over this poverty? Was it true, then, that the
long and hard discipline I had undergone had not
dried up the springs of emotion and imagination, but
had made them deeper and more fervent? On that
February afternoon, warmed by the breath of early
spring, a vapour of poetry rose around me. The babbling
flow of the Saurgo at the foot of rocks fashioned
by fire; the dead city in the marshy river; the peak
of Corace, glittering like a helmet on a threatening
brow; the brown fields, strewn with flints full of
dormant life; the vines and olives, contorted with
the huge effort of producing such rich fruit from such
meagre limbs; the whole aspect of the country around
was symbolical of the power of thoughts nourished
in secret, of the tragic mystery of destinies fulfilled,
of painful energy, tyrannical constraint, proud passion,
of every harsh and rigid virtue peculiar to lonely
scenery or lonely man. And yet the softest of spring
airs breathed over the austere land; silver almond
blossom crowned the hills, as foam crowns the waves;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
under the slanting rays the slopes here and there
wore the look of soft velvet; the rocky peaks were
turned to rosy gold against a sky fading into delicate
green. And so the influence of the season and the
magic of the hour were able to soften the severe
genius of the place, clothe its harshness with tenderness,
temper its violence, and throw a gentle enchantment
over that rocky basin, fashioned by fire at the
terrible bidding of an ancient volcano; afterwards
continually invaded and corroded by the greed, or
enriched by the liberality, of an ancient river.</p>

<p>“We shall see each other very often,” I said, after a
pause, in reply to their kind words. “From Rebursa
to Trigento is a short distance; and I know that in
you I have found two brothers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>They both started as a mountain keeper passed us
at a gallop, discharging his carbine in the air to give
the signal for the salute of welcome and joy. Rebursa
rose before me with its four towers of stone, still
strong and fair, still bearing intact the impress of its
former pride, casting the shadow of its power over a
vigorous race, among whom obedience and fidelity
were transmitted from father to son as a portion of
their inheritance.</p>

<p>But anguish such as I had not felt for long came
over my soul as I set foot on the threshold, strewn
with myrtle and laurel, where there was no beloved
voice to bid me welcome and call me by name. The
figures of my dead appeared to me at the foot of the
staircase, and fixed their colourless eyes on me without
a movement, without a sign, without a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>A little later I followed the carriage with my eyes
for a long, long way on the road to Trigento, as it
bore away the two sad invalids, nearly buried under
flowers. And my soul was there before them at the
park gates, where the three sisters were waiting&mdash;Anatolia,
Violante, Massimilla!&mdash;and I caught a
glimpse of them as they received the fresh gift of
spring in their outstretched arms; and I tried to
recognise their noble faces through the fragrant
thicket, and to discern the brow of her whom my soul
would have elected for the desired union. The
gathering twilight heightened this strange and sudden
agitation caused by the desire for love. Blue
shadows filled the valley of the Saurgo, hid the dead
city, crept slowly up the steep terraces of rock; and
when stars began to twinkle in the sky, down below
festal bonfires were lit; they flared up, multiplied,
formed large wreaths. Lonely and lofty, far apart
from these signs of life below, the pinnacles of
rock still shone, withdrawn almost into the remoteness
of a myth, into the sphere of a supernatural
atmosphere. And all of a sudden they blazed like
fireworks with an extraordinary light, which only
lasted a few moments; then they grew paler, turned
violet, faded away, and went out. The lofty peak of
Corace was the last to remain aflame; its point clove
the sky sharply, like the cry of hopeless passion;
then, with the rapidity of a lightning flash, it faded
away also, and entered the universal night.</p>

<p>“If the severity of thy discipline should have no
other reward than the divine emotion that has overwhelmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
thee since yesterday, thou mightest still
rejoice over the result of thy efforts,” said the <em>dæmon</em>
to me, as we rode slowly towards the walled garden.
“Now at last thou hast reached maturity! Until
yesterday thou knewest not what a degree of maturity
and completeness thy soul had attained. The happy
revelation comes to thee from the desire thou hast
suddenly felt to pour out thy riches, to spread them,
to spend them without stint. Thou dost feel thyself
inexhaustible, capable of nourishing a thousand lives.
This is indeed the prize of thy diligent efforts; thou
possessest now the ready fertility of deeply cultivated
land. Therefore enjoy thy spring; leave thyself
open to all influences; welcome the unknown and
unforeseen, and anything else that fate may bring
thee; abolish all prohibitions. The first part of thy
task is completed. Thou hast given integrity and
intensity to thy nature; let it now be sacred to thee.
Respect the slightest motions of thy thought and
sentiment, because thy nature alone produces them.
Since this nature is entirely thy own, thou mayest
yield to it and enjoy it without limits. From henceforth
everything is permitted to thee, even that
which thou didst hate and despise in others, because
everything becomes ennobled after passing through
the ordeal of fire. Fear not to be merciful, thou who
art strong and able to dominate and chastise. Be
not ashamed of thy perplexity and thy languor, thou
who hast made thyself a will tempered as hard as
beaten swords. Repel not the tenderness which
overwhelms thee, the illusion which enfolds thee, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
melancholy which attracts thee, all the new indefinable
feelings which now approach thy astonished
soul. They are but the dim shapes of vapour which
escape from the life fermenting in the depths of thy
fertile nature. Therefore welcome them without
suspicion, for they are not foreign to thee, nor will
they diminish or corrupt thy nature. Perhaps on
the morrow they will appear to thee as heralds of
that new birth which is thy desire.”</p>

<p>Never since then have I passed an hour at once so
delicious and so painful. I know not if the trees
laden with blossom had as keen a sense of their
vital power as I had of mine on that clear morning;
but they certainly could not feel my vast bewildering
perplexity, innumerable feelings, and innumerable
thoughts. In order to prolong both pain and delight,
I kept my horse at a walk, and lingered on the way,
as if that hour were to close for ever a phase of my
intimate life, and on my arrival at the fated spot
a new and unforeseen phase were to open, the dim
presentiment of which was to be found in my increasing
uneasiness. From time to time the breath of
spring, with its whispering warmth around me,
seemed to waft me up into an ether of dreams, to
efface in me for a few seconds the consciousness of
real personality, and to breathe into me the virgin
ardent soul of one of those hero lovers in fairy tales
who ride to find Sleeping Beauties in the Wood.
Was not I riding towards the maiden princesses
imprisoned in a walled garden? And was not each
one of them perhaps in her secret heart expecting
the Bridegroom?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Already they appeared before me as pictured by
my desire, and already my desire met its first perplexity
in the triple image. I asked myself: “Which
will be the chosen one?” for within my soul I felt at
the same moment the nuptial joy of the one, and the
sepulchral sadness of the other two; I felt all the
germs of future trouble, and already perceived regret
hidden under hope. And again that fear crossed my
spirit which once before had disturbed me in the
midst of my voluntary discipline: the fear of those
blind forces of fate against which the strongest will
may struggle in vain; the fear of that sudden whirlwind
which in a second may seize the boldest and
most tenacious of men, and carry him far away from
the promised goal.</p>

<p>I drew up my horse. The road at that point was
quite deserted; the groom was following me at a distance.
Over the grand, lonely scenery reigned the
deepest silence, only broken at intervals by the whispering
olives; a steady light shone equally over
everything; and in the light and the silence, all
things from small leaves to gigantic rocks appeared
with a clearness of outline that was almost crude. I
felt more strongly than ever the ambiguous something
which had entered into me. And I thought:
“Was not my soul till yesterday filled with the same
clear daylight which now reveals every line of scenery
to my attentive sight? And does not this new
uncertainty cover some great peril? What if a
dangerously large store of poetry has accumulated
within me during my solitude, and now requires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
unlimited expansion? But if I give myself up to the
rushing torrent, where will it carry me? Perhaps
watchful guard against extraneous life may yet
avail; perhaps it may yet avail to refuse to enter the
circle which is suddenly opening before me, and will
enclose me like a magic ring.” And the <em>dæmon</em>
repeated with unhesitating voice: “Fear not! Welcome
the unknown and unforeseen and whatever
else fate may bring thee; abolish all prohibitions;
go onwards safe and free; have no anxiety save to
live. Thy fate can only be fulfilled in the abundance
of life.”</p>

<p>I urged my horse into a trot, vehemently, as if at
that point a great act had been resolved upon. And
Trigento appeared on the slope of the hill with its
stone houses clustering against the parent rock. At
the summit appeared the ancient palace with its
walled garden stretching down the opposite slope to
the plain. It produced the effect of a great cloister
full of forgotten or dead things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I dismounted at the gate I heard the voice of
Oddo, who was looking out for me.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Claudio!”</p>

<p>He ran to meet me with outstretched arms, as
much delighted as the first time.</p>

<p>“I thought you would have come earlier,” he said
in a reproachful tone; “I have been waiting for you
here for the last two hours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“I lingered on the way,” I answered. “I wanted to
renew acquaintance with every tree and stone.”</p>

<p>With one of those strange sudden movements of
his, in which curiosity and timidity were mingled, he
went up to my horse and stroked his neck.</p>

<p>“How beautiful he is!” he murmured, and the
animal’s sensitive neck quivered under the touch of
his slender white hand.</p>

<p>“You can ride him whenever you like,” I said to
him, “either this one or another.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think I could sit in the saddle now,” he
answered; “I believe I should be nervous.... But
come! Come! You are expected.”</p>

<p>And he led me up a path enclosed within walls of
box-wood, feeble with age, and broken here and there
by deep gaps, from which a fresh scent of invisible
violets seemed to issue, strange as the breath of
youth out of a decrepit mouth.</p>

<p>“Yesterday evening,” said Oddo rather uneasily,
“yesterday evening we brought back joy with your
almond blossom. You don’t know what we felt,
alone in that carriage, buried under the flowers!
Antonello was like a child. I never saw him like
that before.”</p>

<p>At intervals the green walls opened out into archways,
and I caught sight of grassy glades where some
long slanting ray of sun pierced the shadow with a
sharp outline.</p>

<p>“I never saw him like that before; I never heard
him talk so much nonsense.”</p>

<p>Stone vases deep and round alternated with statues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
almost clothed with lichen, maimed or headless
statues whose attitudes seemed eloquent to me.
And a few daffodils were flowering round their
pedestals.</p>

<p>“When we arrived here, we could not get out for
the branches. The sisters came to set us free. How
happy they were! They went away laden. We
heard them laughing up the stairs. All such things
are new to us, Claudio.”</p>

<p>A whispered splash reached my ear; the vague
sound of a hidden fountain. An indefinable anxiety
weighed upon my heart.</p>

<p>“We talked about you the whole evening, and
remembered many things of long ago, and perhaps
made some air-castles for the future. Who would
ever have thought of your coming back? But none
of us can believe yet that you will stay.... We feel
as if after a few days you would escape us. It is not
easy to bear this life of ours. Massimilla, you see,
prefers a convent.... Did you not know that
Massimilla is just going to leave us?”</p>

<p>As I walked up the path, brushing against the
walls of vegetation, a strong, bitter odour reached my
nostrils from the little, fresh box leaves which shone
like beryls among the thick green.</p>

<p>“Ah! here is Violante!” exclaimed Oddo, touching
my arm.</p>

<p>At the sudden apparition my heart gave a great
bound, and I felt the colour rise in my face.</p>

<p>She was sitting under a lofty arch of box, with
her feet upon the grass; a strip of meadow seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
through the opening lay behind her, streaked with
gold.</p>

<p>She smiled without rising, waiting till we came
near; and she seemed to be offering her whole beauty
to my astonished gaze in that calm attitude, as she
sat on the green sward where perhaps her fingers had
gathered the numerous violets ornamenting her
girdle. As she stretched out her hand to me, she
looked me full in the face, and said in a voice which
was the perfect musical expression of the form it
came from&mdash;</p>

<p>“You are welcome. We were expecting you
yesterday. Oddo and Antonello brought us your
gift instead, and it was no less acceptable.”</p>

<p>I said: “After many years I am once again entering
your grounds, where I used long ago to accompany
my mother, and already I begin to regret having
stayed so long away. On leaving Rome I knew that
I should find an empty house at Rebursa, but I did
not know how richly Trigento would compensate for
it. I owe you much gratitude.”</p>

<p>“We shall owe you gratitude,” she interrupted, “if
you do not find our society wearisome. You know
that this place is destitute of joy.”</p>

<p>“Even sadness has its benefit for him who understands
how to taste it, has it not?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Besides, I assure you, since I passed the gate I
have experienced none but exquisite sensations here.
This great garden seems to me delicious. It is impossible
not to feel the poetry of its antiquity!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
Yesterday when I saw Oddo and Antonello in
raptures over that almond blossom, as if they had
never seen a flowering tree before, I thought everything
here must be withered and dead. Instead of
which I find within your gates a more enchanting
display of spring than that which I left outside.
Aren’t you tired with gathering violets in the grass?
Your girdle is full of them.”</p>

<p>She smiled and looked down towards her waist,
and with her bare fingers caressed the violets which
adorned it.</p>

<p>“You come from the city,” she said. Her voice
was musical but rather veiled, and the richness of its
tone was a little exhausted, as if very slightly
cracked; “you come from the city, and the country
is offering you her firstfruits.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it is, but certain things always
seem new.”</p>

<p>“We see these things no longer, and love them no
longer,” said Oddo, with some melancholy. “Probably
Violante cannot smell the scent of the flowers she
picks.”</p>

<p>“Is that true?” I asked, turning to her. My eyes
were struck by the profile of marble under her abundant
hair and the motionless attitude, which reminded
one of immortal statues.</p>

<p>“What were you saying?” she asked, like one returning
from far off; she had not heard her brother’s
words.</p>

<p>“Oddo says you cannot smell the scent of the
flowers you pick. Is it true?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>A faint touch of red coloured her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” she answered, with a vivacity quite in
contrast with the slow rhythm to which her life
seemed set. “Don’t believe Oddo. He says that
because I am fond of strong scents; but I can smell
the faintest also, even those of the stones.”</p>

<p>“Of the stones?” said Oddo, laughing.</p>

<p>“What do you know about it, Oddo? Be quiet.”</p>

<p>We were walking up the great flight of steps
covered with trellises leading in symmetrical order
to the palace; she went up slowly between us,
step by step. The stairs were very wide, and she
made a step forward on each, and then each time
paused an instant before putting her foot on the
next, and this movement caused her always to lift
the same foot. Wearied by the frequent repetition
of the movement, she sometimes relaxed her body a
little as she stood with bended knee and slackened
the proud will which kept her figure as erect as a
perfect stalk. An unexpected softness then came
over her superb form; a new rhythm revealed what
I should call the docile graces, the pliant qualities of
love. So strong was the power emanating from this
beautiful being, that I could not take my eyes off
her movements; and I lingered behind so that my
entire gaze should encircle her. She seemed to
drive my spirit back into the marvellous epoch when
artists drew from dormant matter those perfect forms
which men regarded as the only truths worthy of
worship on earth. And I thought as I looked at her
and ascended behind her: “It is right she should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
remain untouched. Only by a god could she be
possessed without shame.” And as her queenly head
passed onwards in the light&mdash;her native element&mdash;I
felt that her beauty was on the verge of its perfect
maturity, of its highest effort, and I thanked fortune
for having permitted me such a sight. “Ah, I shall
worship her, but I shall not dare to love her; I shall
not dare to look into her soul and surprise its secrets.
Yet her every movement reveals that she was made
for love; but it was for barren love, not for the love
that creates. Her body will never bear the disfiguring
burden; the flood of milk will never mar the pure
outline of her bosom.”</p>

<p>She stopped, impatient at the effort, and a little
out of breath, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“How tiring these stairs are! Let us take a rest
here, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Here are Antonello and Anatolia coming down,”
remarked Oddo, who had seen the two, through the
open bars of the trellises, descending the first flight
of steps. “Let us wait for them.”</p>

<p>Moving towards us came she who had been represented
to me as the giver of strength, the beneficent
powerful maiden, the rich and generous soul. She
appeared from the first as a support, for Antonello
was leaning on her arm, and setting his hesitating
steps to the measure of her firm ones.</p>

<p>“Which of us,” asked Violante suddenly, but so
lightly as to remove all indiscretion from the question,
“which of us do you remember least indistinctly?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know,” I answered vaguely, for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
ears were listening to the rustle of Anatolia’s dress.</p>

<p>“But certainly the figures I remember have hardly
anything in common with the present reality. Since
the day I went away we have passed through that
period of life when transformations are most rapid
and most deep.”</p>

<p>The two others had come up. Anatolia also put
out her hand, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“You are welcome.”</p>

<p>Her actions had a kind of manly frankness, and
the contact of her hand gave me an impression of
generous strength and genuine kindness; it seemed
to inspire me suddenly with brotherly confidence.</p>

<p>It was a hand unadorned with rings, not too white
nor too slim, but robust in its pure shape, ready to
clasp and to give support, flexible and firm at the
same time. There was an impress of pride on its
surface, varied as it was by the low relief of the joints
and the intricacy of the veins, and there were lines
of softness in the hollow warmth of the palm, where
a radiant fire of feeling seemed to glow.</p>

<p>“You are welcome,” said the warm, cordial voice.
“You have brought us spring and sunshine from
Rome&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” I interrupted. “I found them both here.
In Rome I left nothing but mist and other gloomy
things. I have just been saying how much I regret
having stayed away from here so long.”</p>

<p>“You must make amends to us for your forgetfulness,”
said Antonello with his painful smile.</p>

<p>“What do you think of Trigento?” asked Anatolia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
“It is hardly changed at all, is it? You used to come
here with your mother. You remember, don’t you?
We have never forgotten her, nor ever shall. Among
the things which have remained unchanged here, you
will find the memory of that saintly soul and her
wonderful kindness.”</p>

<p>A grave silence followed these words of recollection.
For a few moments the sense of death which
fell upon my filial heart threw an aspect of unreality
on all the persons and things present. For a few
moments everything seemed to become as far away
and empty as the sky whose fading colour I could
see through the bare vine branches of the trellis as
if through a ragged net. But as the brief illusion
vanished, I felt myself nearer to her who had produced
it, and I could not waste time again in idle
words. I wanted to penetrate into the heart of their
sadness.</p>

<p>“And Donna Aldoina?” I asked in a low voice,
turning to Anatolia, and speaking now to her alone.</p>

<p>Was she not probably the real guardian of the
gloomy dwelling? By calling up the memory of
death had she not herself raised the image of the
lunatic?</p>

<p>“She is still just the same,” she replied, also in a
low voice. “It is better you should not see her, to-day
at least. It would be too painful for you. And
imagine what it is for us! It is a daily torture, a
torture that has lasted for years without pause, to
the wearing of our souls....” Her eyes cast a
momentary furtive look towards Antonello, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
read in them the secret terror that she felt for the
poor invalid who was trembling on the precipice.</p>

<p>“We have never had the courage to separate her
from us, to send her away,” she added, “for she is not
violent; in fact, she is quite gentle. Sometimes she
seems cured; we almost believe that a miracle has
come to pass; she calls us by our names, remembers
some little thing that happened long ago, and smiles
calmly. Although we know that it is all an illusion,
every time we tremble with hope, every time we
choke with anxiety. You understand....”</p>

<p>Her voice lost its tone in her sorrow, like a loose
musical string.</p>

<p>“It is impossible to confine her to her rooms, to
keep her shut up; it is impossible. And we have
not the heart to avoid her when she appears, when
she comes to meet us, when she speaks to us. So
she is continually at our side; she is mingled with
our existence....”</p>

<p>“Some days,” interrupted Antonello suddenly, with
a kind of impetuosity, as if driven on by uncontrollable
excitement, “some days the whole house is full
of her. We breathe her madness. One or other of
us stays by her for hours and hours while she talks
on; sits opposite her with hands imprisoned in those
trembling hands of hers. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>A new and still more oppressive silence fell upon
us all. And every one of us was suffering, as he
acknowledged in his soul the reality of the sorrow
which the slender blue shadows of the trellis, mingled
with the gentle gold of the sun, seemed to wrap in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
a veil of dreams. Through the silence the sound of
a light footfall was heard coming up the lower flight
of steps. At regular intervals came a faint bubbling
sound as if a fountain was overflowing its basin. A
mysterious quiver seemed to shake the lonely garden
below. And I understood how a gloomy and feeble
mind might construct an unreal life out of these
phantoms, and nourish it till overcome by it.</p>

<p>Thus the torture to which destiny had condemned
these last survivors of a fallen race was suddenly revealed
to me in all its horrors; and the vision called
up by the words of one who was certainly to become
a victim appeared to me magnified by a tragic light.
In imagination I could see the mad old princess
sitting in the shadow of her distant apartment, and
one of her children leaning over her, with hands
imprisoned in hers. The attitude of this mournful
enchantress seemed to me fatal and inexorable. I
felt as if she were unconsciously drawing all the
children of her blood one after the other into the
circle of her madness, and as if not one of them
would be able to escape that blind and cruel force.
Like an ancestral Erinnys, she was presiding over
the dissolution of her race.</p>

<p>Then through the bare branches of the trellis I
gazed up at the silent palace, which till that day had
harboured in its grim depths such desperate anguish,
and hidden so many useless tears&mdash;tears falling from
pure and eager eyes, worthy of reflecting the most
glorious sights of the world, and of pouring joy into
the soul of poets and rulers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“Eyes of Beauty!” I thought, gazing again at the
motionless Violante. “What earthly misery can veil
the splendour of the truth that shines forth from you?
What afflicted soul can fail to acknowledge the consoling
power that flows from you?” The pain I had
been feeling ceased suddenly, as if balm had been
applied; the troublous images faded away like a
mournful vapour.</p>

<p>She was seated motionless on a stone plinth which
had once supported an urn. Her elbow rested on
her knee, her chin in her hand; in this simple attitude
her whole figure expressed that succession of mute
harmonies which is the secret of supreme art. She
seemed to be present with us, and yet apart. Upon
her low forehead was visible the reflection of the ideal
crown that she wore upon her thoughts; and her hair,
gathered up in a great knot on her neck, seemed to
have obeyed the same rhythm which regulates the
repose of the sea.</p>

<p>“Massimilla,” said Oddo, introducing the third
sister.</p>

<p>I turned, and found she was already close to us.
She was ascending the last steps with her light tread.
Her face and her whole person bore traces of the
dream in which she had been plunged, of the intimate
poetry of the hour just past, spent with a faithful
book in the solitude of the nook known to her alone.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” asked Oddo before she
reached us.</p>

<p>She smiled shyly, and a faint colour tinged her
thin cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“Down there,” she answered, “reading.”</p>

<p>Her voice sounded liquid and silvery as it came
through the delicate lips. There was a blade of grass
as a marker in the pages of her book.</p>

<p>As I bowed she gave me her hand, still with the
same shy smile. And something of the tender compassion
I used to feel long ago for the little invalid
my mother visited awoke again in my soul; for her
hand was so slight and soft, that it reminded me of
those slender flowers called day lilies, which bloom
for one day only in the hot sand.</p>

<p>She did not speak, and neither could I find words
delicate enough to be appropriate to her timid grace.</p>

<p>“Shall we go up?” said Anatolia, turning to me,
her clear voice at once breaking through the kind
of spell which the unutterable melancholy of our
thoughts had cast over us as we sat in the warmth
under the trellis.</p>

<p>“Our father wants so much to see you again,” and
we all began to ascend the steps towards the palace.</p>

<p>The three sisters went first, a little apart from each
other, Anatolia first, Massimilla last. They said a
few words now and then in turn, for the silence of
things around demanded the sound of their voices,
and perhaps they hoped to chase away the sadness
of that silence from over the head of their guest.
Those short sonorous cadences flowing from unseen
lips grew fainter as I advanced; and I ascended
with the voices and the shadows of the maidens
round me, feeling as amazed and perplexed as if
I were in enchantment. But though the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
rhythms alternated in my ear, to my sight they
appeared simultaneous and continuous, so that from
time to time my spirit would listen attentively to seize
the difference, or would take a concave form, so to
speak, that therein they might melt into one deep harmony.
And like those episodes which in a fugue fill
up the silence of the theme, the aspect of the things
we passed, or the peculiarities of the forms, entered
into me, and enriched my musical sense without
ruffling it. Marks of decay and neglect were strewn
over the ancient steps, here and there still encumbered
with the spoils of the previous autumn. There
was the statue of a recumbent nymph, with the head
bent in a painful position, for the moss-stained brow
was deprived of the support of the arm. In a long
vase of reddish clay, like a sarcophagus, common
grass was growing, and in the midst of this hostile
invasion a single plant of daffodils was flowering
feebly and tremulously. Under a bit of broken
parapet thrown down by the penetrating roots of the
ivy appeared an inner channel like a broken artery;
and one saw the sparkle and heard the murmur of
the water as it flowed to fill the heart of the weeping
fountain. Marks of decay and neglect were strewn
on our path. The statue, the flower, and the water
spoke to me of the same truth. And Violante, and
Massimilla, and Anatolia were transfigured in my
mind by means of mysterious analogies.</p>

<p>“Oh, beautiful souls,” I thought, as I measured the
rhythm of their visible existence, “is not the perfection
of human love perhaps to be found in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
trinity? You are the triple form which appeared to
my desire in the hour of the great harmony. In you
all the highest needs of my flesh and spirit might be
satisfied; and you might become the miraculous
instruments of my will and of my fate in the fulfilment
of the work I have to do. Are you not such as
I myself would have created to adorn with sublime
beauty and sorrow, the mysterious world of which I
am the creator? To-day, I know nothing of you
beyond the outward appearance and a few passing
words; but I feel that ere long each one of you in
her entire being will correspond to the image which
breathes and throbs within me.”</p>

<p>Thus did the three sisters ascend in my aspirations
and my prayers, each one obedient to the secret
music that was guiding her life towards an unknown
end. And their figures threw great shadows on the
stone.</p>

<p>When I set foot on the threshold, the fantastic
image of the mad woman took hold of my mind so
vividly and fiercely that I gave a secret shudder.
The whole place seemed to me to be under her
sinister sway, saddened and cast down by her perpetual
presence. I thought I read the same uneasiness
in the faces of her children. And I felt as if
we should find her awaiting us at the top of the
stairs.</p>

<p>Anatolia guessed my thoughts, and softly said to
reassure me&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid.... You won’t see her.... I
have arranged that you should not see her, just now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
at any rate.... Try not to think of her, so that our
hospitality may not seem too gloomy.”</p>

<p>Antonello was looking up through the glass of the
loggia which surrounded the court, and watching with
those anxious eyes and trembling eyelids of his.</p>

<p>“Do you see the grass?” exclaimed Oddo, pointing
out to me the long blades of green growing along the
walls and in the interstices of the paving-stones.</p>

<p>“It is the token and augury of peace,” I said, trying
to shake off the oppression and be cheerful. “I was
sorry not to find it yesterday in my own courtyard.
They had taken it away, but I should have preferred
it to all the festive leaves of myrtle and laurel.
Grass ought to be allowed to grow, especially in very
large houses. It is a living thing the more.”</p>

<p>The courtyard resounded like the nave of a church,
and the echoes were quick to catch up even the
words spoken lowest. As I looked at the silent
fountain, I thought of the mysterious music with
which the water might have invited those attentive
and favourable echoes.</p>

<p>“Why is the fountain dumb?” I asked, wishing to
take every opportunity of supporting the cause of
life in that cloister filled with forgotten or dead
things. “Further down on the steps, I heard the
sound of water.”</p>

<p>“You must apply to Antonello,” said Violante. “It
is he who imposed silence on it.”</p>

<p>The face of the unfortunate invalid coloured
slightly, and his eyes grew troubled, as though he
were going to yield to an impulse of anger. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
seemed almost as if Violante’s harmless accusation
had made him ashamed and sorrowful, or as if a dispute
already closed had been reopened. He contained
himself, but annoyance altered his voice.</p>

<p>“Fancy, Claudio, my rooms are up there,” he said,
pointing to one side of the loggia, “and from there
one can hear the fountain roaring like a waterfall.
Just think! The noise is distracting, something
incredible. Don’t you hear what an echo the voice
has here? And in the daytime too!”</p>

<p>His whole tall, thin body quivered with aversion to
noise, with the nervous horror, the uncontrollable
abhorrence of which he had shown signs the day
before when he started at the shots from the carbine
and the shouts of the men.</p>

<p>“But I wish you could hear it at night,” he continued
excitedly. “I wish you could hear it! The
water is water no longer; it is a lost soul, howling,
laughing, sobbing, stammering, jeering, calling, commanding.
It is something incredible! Sometimes
as I have lain awake listening, I have forgotten that
it was water; and I have not been able to remember....
Do you understand?”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, evidently trying to control
himself, and he looked distractedly at Anatolia.
The pain in her face disappeared under that look; it
was hidden and controlled. And she, as if to disperse
the uneasiness we all felt, said almost gaily:
“Indeed, Antonello is not exaggerating. Shall we
call up the lost soul? Nothing is easier.”</p>

<p>We were all there round the dry fountain. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
unexpected halt, the words and the look of the unhappy
man, the solemnity of the enclosed court, the
silvery coldness of the light that rained down from
above, and the approaching metamorphosis, seemed
to confer something of the mystery of a work of
magic on that ancient, lifeless thing. The mass of
marble&mdash;a pompous composition of Neptune’s horses,
tritons, dolphins, and shells in triple order&mdash;rose
before our eyes, covered with a greyish crust of
dried-up lichens, glittering white here and there like
an aspen stem; and all the human and animal
mouths seemed still in their silence to preserve the
same attitudes in which but lately liquid voices had
flowed from their lips.</p>

<p>“Stand back,” added Anatolia, as she stooped down
over a bronze disc that covered a round aperture in
the pavement near the edge of the lower basin. “I
am going to turn on the water.”</p>

<p>And she put her finger through the ring in the
middle of the disc, and tried to lift its weight; but
she could not, and rose up with her face scarlet from
the exertion. I came to her assistance, and when it
was open, she stooped again and found the secret
spring with her hand. We both stood back in mutual
agreement, and now the bubbling water was to be
heard rising in the veins of the empty fountain.</p>

<p>And there was a moment of anxious expectation,
as if the mouths of the monsters were about to give
answer. Involuntarily I pictured the joy of the
stone as the fresh liquid life invaded it, and imagined
to myself the impossible shudders it must feel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>The tritons were blowing their trumpets, the
dolphins’ throats were gurgling. From the top a jet
of water sprang up hissing, clear and quick as a
sword-thrust sent into the blue; it broke, retired,
hesitated, rose again straighter and stronger than
ever; it hung in the air, turned adamant, shot up
like a stalk, and seemed to burst into flower. First
a short, sharp sound like the crack of a whip echoed
through the court, then came something like a burst
of Homeric laughter, then a thunder of applause, then
a shower of rain. Every mouth sent out a jet of
water, and each jet curved into an arch to fill
the shell beneath. Here and there the stone was
sprinkled with dark stains, and the smooth parts
shone, and the rivulets grew more and more numerous;
at last every part of it rejoiced at the touch of
the water; it seemed to open all its pores to the
countless drops, and revive like a tree refreshed by
a cloud. Rapidly the slightest hollows filled up,
overflowed, and took the shape of silver crowns,
continually destroyed and as continually renewed.
Every instant as the play was multiplied by the
variety of the sculpture, the continuous sounds grew
louder and formed a deeper and deeper music in the
great echo of the walls. Above the voluble symphony
of water falling into water rose the mighty
bubbling and gushing of the central jet, as it dashed
the marvellous flowers that came out from moment
to moment at the top of its stalk against the necks of
the Tritons.</p>

<p>“Do you hear?” exclaimed Antonello, as he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
at this triumph with eyes of enmity. “Do you think
this racket would be tolerable for long?”</p>

<p>“Ah, I could stay here for hours and days listening
to it,” I thought I heard Violante saying, in a voice
more veiled than ever. “There is no music I love
so well.”</p>

<p>She had stayed so near the fountain that she was
sprinkled all over with drops, and her hair was strewn
with sparkling dust. The power of her beauty again
excluded any other thought, any discordant image
from my mind. Again she seemed to me isolated
and unapproachable, outside of the sphere of ordinary
life, more like a vision of art than a creature of our
own species. Everything round her acknowledged
the sovereignty of her presence, for everything referred
to, and submitted to, and harmonised with,
her beauty. Like the great arch of green that bent
over her when first she appeared to me, like the ancient
plinth on which she had rested, this musical fountain
open to the sky seemed created for her alone; it
seemed to correspond perfectly with that ideal harmony
expressed in her simple attitude. Secret and inexplicable
affinities united the most diverse things to
her being, and brought back all surrounding mysteries
to the mystery of herself. Since nature in this human
form had revealed one of her supreme ideas of perfection,
it seemed to me that all other ideas in all
other mortal shapes should by nature serve to lead
the spirit of the beholder to contemplate that one
supreme idea.</p>

<p>And so it came about, that as I watched the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
maiden by the fountain I discovered and treasured
up a pure truth: “When Beauty reveals herself, all
the elements of life converge towards her as towards
a centre, and so she has for her tribute the entire
Universe.”</p>

<p>“One of our troubles,” said Oddo, as we walked up
the wide balustraded staircase, upon whose silent walls
the sixteenth century decorations of streamers and
clouds imitated the fury of a tempest, “one of our
troubles is the vastness of the house; it gives us a
feeling of being astray, a humiliating feeling of our
own littleness.”</p>

<p>The building was, in fact, a great deal too spacious
and too empty. It had been restored in the seventeenth
century, and transformed from a feudal fortress
into a country villa, and all the formidable hugeness
of its walls and vaults remained, although successive
epochs had left the impress of art and of luxury,
sometimes on their surface, and sometimes in contrast
to them. The enormous number of mirrors
with which whole walls were covered multiplied the
space into infinity. And nothing was more mournful
than those pale, delusive abysses, which seemed
to open into a supernatural world, and to promise at
every moment to show the living beholder visions of
the dead.</p>

<p>“Claudio, my boy!” exclaimed Prince Luzio in a
voice full of emotion, coming forward as soon as he
saw me. “Dear, dear boy!”</p>

<p>I felt his old worn body tremble as he embraced
me and kissed me on the forehead in a fatherly way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
With his hand still on my shoulder, he gazed long
into my face as if in a dream, while a wave of
memories, sorrows, and complaints passed across the
ashy blue of his feeble eyes.</p>

<p>“How like you are to your father!” he added, in
a still more affectionate voice, and his emotion took
possession of me also. “It is a marvellous likeness.
I feel as though I beheld Massenzio again in his
youth, when we were companions in the Life Guards....
He seems to have come to life again. How
like him you are, my boy!”</p>

<p>He took me by the hand and led me to the window,
as if he wished to withdraw with me into the contemplation
of long past things.</p>

<p>“How like him you are!” he repeated when he saw
my face in the full light. “Oh, if that blessed soul
were only living still. He ought not to have died,
my God, he ought not to have died.”</p>

<p>He shook his head in token of regret over the
phantom of that beautiful life so early cut off. And
the sincerity of his affection was so great, that I was
touched to the bottom of my soul, and I could no
longer feel a stranger in that house where the memory
of my dead was kept so reverently fresh. “Look,”
added the Prince, stroking the point of his white
beard, and smiling a smile in which I caught glimpses
of Anatolia’s noble sweetness; “look how old I have
grown!”</p>

<p>His whole figure betrayed a painful feebleness, but
the radiance of his premature white hair gave his
head a look of venerable majesty, and his brow still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
bore the hereditary stamp of his lordly race. His
hands had escaped almost by a miracle from any
injury by sickness and old age; there was no aged
deformity about them. They were still strong and
fair as if embalmed; those liberal hands of the
munificent noble who had lavished his riches on the
path of the exile, only that the eyes of his king
might shine awhile longer with the reflection of fallen
royalty. And as a kind of memorial of the treasures
so prodigally spent there shone a cameo in his signet
ring.</p>

<p>Those hands with their slow movements seemed,
as the sluggish blood revived with the heat
of memories, to be drawing some remnant of a
vanished world out of a sphere of shadow, and this
faculty gave them a singular meaning in my eyes.
When the old man sat down and laid his hands on
the arms of the chair, they seemed to me like relics,
and I looked at them with a strange feeling of almost
superstitious respect. They made me feel, very
strongly, as if I were living at that moment in my
own world of poetry, and not in the world of fact.</p>

<p>Seeing my eyes fixed on the carved gem, the
prince smiled and said: “It is Violante’s portrait.”</p>

<p>He took off the ring and handed it to me.</p>

<p>The delicate work was by some ancient artist
not unworthy of Pirgotelus or Dioscuridas; but the
divine features of the Medusa, relieved against the
blood-red background of sardonyx, corresponded so
perfectly to the likeness of the proud creature, that
I thought: “Truly then did she illuminate the art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
of bygone days, and from time immemorial bestowed
upon durable matter the privilege of perpetuating
the Idea of which she is to-day the Incarnation.”</p>

<p>“Her mother used to wear this ring just before she
was born,” added the prince with the same gentle
smile, “and she was always looking at it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In such a manner, and at every moment, the conformity
of things raised my spirit into an ideal state,
which resembled a state of reverie and second-sight
without actually attaining to it, and this same conformity
furnished harmonious material to my sensibility
and imagination. And I watched the continuous
generation of a higher life within myself, which transfigured
everything as if by the virtue of a magic
glass.</p>

<p>The three elect beings seemed mutually to throw
light and shade on each other, and the lights and
shades had the significance of a language which I
was already able to interpret as clearly as if it had
been familiar to me for long. And so I stood not
only bewildered by the reflection of the rock, but
struck by the lightning flashes of my thoughts, when
Violante went up to an open window, pointed out
a view which she seemed to have called up with a
wave of her hand, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Look.”</p>

<p>It was a window facing north, on the opposite side
of the palace from the garden, and it looked out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
over a precipice. As I leant out an impetuous
shudder ran through me, and raised me suddenly to
a sentiment of appreciation of this silent and terrible
grandeur.</p>

<p>“Is this your secret?” I asked the enchantress, but
I did not put my question into words, for at her side
silence itself seemed eloquent. The rock descended
abruptly from the massive buttresses which supported
the northern wall, till at the bottom it ended in a
hard white river bed, whose very dryness seemed
ominous of the ruinous anger of a torrent. With
that same atrocious, desperate violence which the
lava streams have as they rush down to the Sicilian
Sea, and rebound and rise up and twist themselves
into black and red masses, screaming, roaring, hissing
at the first contact with the water; with that
same violence the rock at the bottom of the river-bed
rose and flung itself heavenwards, and towered
opposite the great wall built by man, with a kind of
dumb fury animating its gigantic mass. All the
wildest convulsions and contortions of bodies possessed
by demoniac power or deadly spasms seemed
petrified for ever in that terrible form, terrible as the
cliff whence Dante caught sight of fresh horrors on
his way to the river of blood guarded by the Centaurs.
All the shapes of which pliable metal and
scoriæ are capable were there contrasted with the
hard stone; ringlets of rebellious hair, coils of angry
serpents, intricacies of roots laid bare, sheaves of
muscles, circles of the whirlpool, folds of draperies,
twists of rope. This vision of frenzied turbulence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
rose perfectly motionless in the blaze of the midday
sun, without a line of shadow. The throbbing of a
high fever seemed hidden beneath the lifeless crust.</p>

<p>“Is this your secret?” I repeated to the enchantress,
still without words, for my inward agitation would
not allow me to select or control the accents of my
voice.</p>

<p>She stood beside me, silent also; and I did not
look at her, nor did she look at me. But as we leant
out towards the many shaped rock, we were united to
each other by the same fascination which draws
together those who read out of the same book. We
were both reading out of the same fascinating,
dangerous book.</p>

<p>She said, as she raised her head with a slight start&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you hear the hawks?”</p>

<p>And we both searched the summits with dazzled
eyes.</p>

<p>“Listen.”</p>

<p>The rock rose to heaven bristling with points and
stained a reddish colour like rust or clotted blood;
and the screams of the birds of prey heightened the
impression of its savage pride.</p>

<p>Then a sudden giddiness overwhelmed me&mdash;a sort
of horror of too vast ambitions and desires. Perhaps
in the very depths of my being the primitive feelings
of early forefathers awoke; for my indescribable
agitation took the form of a lightning-like succession
of flashing visions, in which I saw men like myself
pouring into vanquished cities, leaping over heaps of
corpses and ruins, with untiring gestures, thrusting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
their swords into men’s bodies, carrying half-naked
women on their saddle-bows through the innumerable
flames of a conflagration, while their horses, lithe
cruel animals like leopards, waded up to their bellies
in blood.</p>

<p>“Ah, I should have known how to possess thee in
the midst of slaughter under a canopy of fire, overshadowed
by the wing of death!” said the soul of
my ancestors to her who stood by my side. “My
will would have urged my body to the performance
of prodigies of valour; and though I had had to
clamber up the smooth sides of this wall, defended
by a thousand bowmen, yet I should have borne
thee away alive.”</p>

<p>Filled with the glow from this magnificent and
tremendous desolation reaching to the heavens, my
eyes fell on the maiden’s face, and saw it so strongly
lit up by the reflection, that an almost painful joy
swept over me. And I felt a mad desire to take that
head in my hands, turn it back, bring it close to my
lips, gaze on it more closely, impress every line of it
in my thought&mdash;a feeling not unlike his who finds
under the barren soil some sublime fragment which
will reveal to the world the glory of an idea for long
nearly extinct.</p>

<p>She was like a statue placed in full view of the
rising sun; her perfection did not fear the light. In
her bodily form I saw the impress of the eternal type,
and at the same moment I recognised the fragility of
the flesh, which bore no immunity from human fate.
She was like a delicious fruit at the highest point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
of its maturity, beyond which point corruption sets
in. The skin of her face had the wonderful transparency
of the blossom which to-morrow will fade.</p>

<p>“Who shall deliver thee from the sacrilege of Time
the destroyer? Who shall slay thee with a mortal
dart at the summit of thy perfection when the
miserable signs of decay begin to appear?” The
dark saying of her brother came back to my mind:
“Violante is killing herself with perfumes.” ... And
silently I worshipped her, with a religious desire to
praise her in her every movement. “Oh sovereign
being, feeling thou art perfect, thou dost also feel the
necessity of death; thou dost know that only death
can preserve thee from all base injury; and since
everything in thee is noble, thou dost purpose to
offer to that solemn custody a body royally
embalmed in perfumes.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After such draughts of balmy wine, how could the
meal to which we sat down have any savour?</p>

<p>Yet the vague and colourless things that surrounded
my musings composed themselves into a
kind of quiet harmony, which little by little soothed
the passion that had been kindled in my soul by
the volcanic rock.</p>

<p>The walls were covered with mirrors, symmetrically
divided all round into compartments by little gilt
pillars, while the surface of each compartment was
painted with festoons and clusters of roses alternately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
and the mirrors were tarnished and green as the
waters of lonely pools, and the little pillars were
delicately twisted like the fair locks of girls, and the
roses were faint and languid as the garlands which
crown the waxen martyrs in sanctuaries. But in
honour perhaps of the guest who was the donor, the
long branches of almond blossom had been ingeniously
wreathed among the sconces of the candelabra.
They spread their still fresh and living blossoms
over the ancient mirrors, and multiplied reflections
in the green pallor seemed to create the semblance
of a far-off watery springtime.</p>

<p>There was a kind of quiet charm about all these
things which seemed to descend and mingle with
Massimilla’s grace; so much so, that I felt as if the
maiden already promised to Jesus shared their
nature. She seemed already to wear the appearance
of a being “who has departed from this present age,”
like Beatrice in the vision of the Vita Nuova, as if,
with her meek air, she were saying also: “I am
about to behold the beginning of peace.”</p>

<p>She sat opposite me, and I looked at her, till this
fancy of mine grew so strong that I began to imagine
her absent and her place empty for a few moments.
And immediately the empty space was filled with a
deep shadow resembling the mouth of a pit into
which all the kindred were to be cast, one after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
another. And thus I was able to attain a unique
and tragic vision of all these living beings, in the
extraordinarily clear relief afforded by that background
of shadow.</p>


<p>They were eating a meal round the accustomed
table; they made the ordinary movements demanded
by natural necessity; from time to time they said a
few simple words. But their tones and actions
seemed accompanied by a mystery which at times
endowed them with an almost terrible significance
or again at times made them almost as laughable as
the play of automatons. One contrast was cruelly
clear, that between the manner of vital functions
they were fulfilling and the signs of inevitable destruction
which were being fulfilled in them. Seated
on the right of Massimilla, Antonello displayed in
his whole behaviour a sort of repressed impatience,
as if he were compelled to use his hands to feed,
not himself, but a stranger. And as I gazed at him,
an intuition flashed through me of the horror that
strangled him as he realised the presence of a
stranger within him, a presence dimly felt as yet,
but still certain. And my eyes, passing instinctively
to Oddo, who sat on Massimilla’s left, noticed in his
attitude something like a feeble reflection of his
brother’s discomfort. Nothing seemed to me sweeter
than that virginal figure sitting calm amidst their
restlessness, like a statue of prayer.</p>

<p>A strange odour of honey from the almond blossom
filled the warm air. Sometimes a petal, rosier
than the others, dropped down the mirror and fell as
into silent water. And I remembered our stay in
the orchard.</p>

<p>Ah, indeed, how could those wretched eyes, tormented
by phantoms, perceive pure and beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
things? What was I doing there myself except
holding a commemoration of the dead? Everything
round me grew dim like the walls, and seemed to
recede into a distant past; everything assumed an
antiquated and faded look, and appeared to be
covered with dust. The two servants moved slowly
and dreamily about in their blue liveries and long
white stockings; they looked as if they had come out
of an old wardrobe of the last century;&mdash;melancholy
ruins of former luxury. When they withdrew they
seemed to vanish like shadows into the delusive
distance of the mirrors, and to re-enter their inanimate
world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the spell was broken by the voice of the
prince, a voice which called up old memories.
Every one kept a respectful silence while he was
speaking; and no sound was heard but that of his
deep aged voice, which at times became hoarse with
repressed anger, or trembled with heartfelt sorrow
and regret.</p>

<p>It chanced to be a disastrous day for the old man;
it was the anniversary of the king’s flight to Gaeta;
it completed the twenty-first year of exile.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, as he turned to me with a glance
kindling with faith, looking, with his white beard,
almost like one of the ancient prophets, “well,
Claudio, when a king falls as Francis of Bourbon fell
at Gaeta, that is to say, like a martyr and a hero, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
is impossible not to believe that God will raise him
up again and restore his kingdom. Mark my words,
son of Massenzio Cantelmo, and do not forget them.
And God grant that this come to pass before my
eyes are closed! That is my only desire.”</p>

<p>He was preparing an apotheosis of fire and blood
on the ruins of the strong city for the pale ghost of
royalty.</p>

<p>“Wonderful faith!” I thought, as I saw what sparks
could still glow in the ashy blue of those feeble eyes.
“Wonderful and vain faith! The power of the
Bourbons slumbers at San Dionigi.” And as the old
man’s words called up the gleaming vision of the
Bavarian heroine, my contempt increased for that
king of twenty-three, on whom Fortune had bestowed
the very horse which carried Henry of Navarre to
Paris, and who was cowardly enough, like the miserable
Philip <span class="allsmcap">V.</span>, to have no ambition to ride anything
more substantial than the imaginary horses of the
tapestries that lined his walls.</p>

<p>“What a magnificent enterprise lay before that
Bourbon prince when he departed from the palace at
Caserta, where the doctors were busy embalming the
corpse of his murdered father as it lay pierced with
innumerable wounds!” I thought, in the eager spirit
which the warlike images evoked by the venerable
old man had kindled in me. “Nothing was wanting
to incite him, not even the corruption and odour of
corpses, which are powerful to inspire thoughts of
greatness. In very truth, everything was his: the
lordly power of an ancient name, youth, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
attracts and carries men away, kingship over three
fair seas accustomed to tyranny, a rich kingdom in
sight of a curved bay sonorous as a lyre, a passionate
companion, who seemed to draw in through
her delicate nostrils the atmosphere of heroic ambitions,
a temperament capable of trembling with
the voluptuousness of power, and full of the electric
current which directs the hurricane. All these were
his to enjoy and to defend; and still, as exiled
husband on the farthest shore of another sea, his ear
was filled with the clamour of his faithful people,
although another kind of clamour reached him
also; and the opportunity was offered to him of a
splendid struggle beyond the limits of his dominions,
on fields already watered with blood, and smoking
with the strength of their fermentation&mdash;fields open
to the strongest thought, the noblest word, the swiftest
sword. In very truth, everything was his, save the
lion’s nature. Why was it Fortune’s will to heap the
burden of such favours upon a feeble, lamb-like
nature? Never did blood so cowardly flow in youthful
veins, never was there a more torpid sensuality.
The very beauty of his lawful kingdom, the divine
outlines of the shore, the balmy air, the mystery of
the nights, all the enchantments of the dying summer,
ought at least to have touched the senses of the youth,
to have awaked in him the deep desire for possession,
to have communicated to him the savage rage for
living. Ah, that last evening in the almost deserted
palace, forsaken by the courtiers, with the strong
breath of the sea wind blowing through the empty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
halls, and bringing with it September perfumes, and
the supreme sweetness of the gulf, while the closed
curtains waved mysteriously and spread a vague
terror, while the lights flickered and went out on the
tables, still strewn with the shameful letters announcing
the flight of those the prince had counted as most
devoted. And the desolation of that departure in the
twilight, in the small ship commanded by a man of the
people, one of the few who remained faithful; and
the silent encounter with the warships, already gone
over to the enemy, and full of treachery; and the long,
sleepless night passed on deck in vain regrets, while
the weary queen slept under the stars, exposed to the
chill night air; and at last, at sunrise, the rock of
Gaeta, the final refuge, fated to be the final ruin,
where the royal dignity was to be forced to come to
terms with a bragging soldier!”</p>

<p>“Treason was everywhere, like the smoke and smell
of gunpowder,” continued the prince. He grew more
and more troubled by these sanguinary recollections,
and from time to time a gesture from the white hand
on which the cameo gleamed gave animation to his
words. “The most terrible day of the siege was the
fifth of February; and the powder magazine of the
Sant’ Antonio battery was blown up by treachery.”</p>

<p>“Ah! what an atrocious thing it was!” exclaimed
Violante, with a shudder and an instinctive movement
as if to cover her ears with her hands. “How
terrible!”</p>

<p>“You can still remember it,” her father said, looking
at her with softer eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“I always shall.”</p>

<p>“Violante was with us at Gaeta,” he added, turning
to me. “She was scarcely five years old, and was a
great pet of the queen’s. The others had started for
Civita Vecchia on the <em>Volcano</em> with the Contessa di
Trapani. We were staying in the artillery quarters
beneath the shore batteries....”</p>

<p>“I can remember it all!” interrupted Violante,
seized by a sudden emotion, which seemed to sweep
over her from that great purple light which lit up her
far-off infancy. “Everything&mdash;everything seems as
distinct as if it had happened yesterday! The room
was divided by two partitions, made of flags sewn
together. I can see the colours quite clearly; they
were signalling flags, blue, yellow, and red. It was
three or four in the afternoon when the explosion
happened. Nina Rizzo, the queen’s lady-in-waiting,
had just gone out. I was holding in my hand a cup
of milk which the sisters at the hospital had sent
me....”</p>

<p>She spoke on thus, in short sentences, in a somewhat
muffled voice, with a fixed look, describing
all these little details, one after the other, as if she
were seeing them in a series of flashes. And the
scenes called up by her words, as she sat looking
into the past, stood out with an extraordinary
force against the confused background of the actual
scene.</p>

<p>The old man and the maiden, as each in turn they
commemorated the ruin and slaughter of other days,
seemed to annihilate all the vague, colourless surroundings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
and create a kind of fiery atmosphere, in
which my soul for a moment gasped painfully. The
siege went on with all its horrors, in the city crowded
with soldiers, horses, and mules, short of provisions
and money, badly or insufficiently armed, scourged
with typhus and villainy. Rain came down in torrents,
filling the streets with black mire, in the
midst of which the starving horses wandering about
sank down and perished. The iron hailstones
riddled the city, dismantled it, laid it low, set fire to
it, and grew ever thicker and noisier, never ceasing
save for the brief intervals appointed for the burial
of the decaying corpses. In the churches divine
service was celebrated, the Invincible Patroness was
invoked, and all the while the stones were being torn
from the walls, the windows were crashing in, and
out of the distance came the groans of the wounded
as they were carried away on stretchers. The sick
men in the hospital raised themselves in their beds
when a shell pierced through the passage walls, and
expecting death, cried as the shell burst, “Long live
the King!” All on a sudden a powder magazine exploded,
shaking the city to its very foundations, and
leaving it suffocated with smoke and with terror,
while in the open cavity bastions, cannons, palisades,
batteries, houses, and hundreds and hundreds of men
were engulfed. But from time to time, on very sunny
days, a kind of heroic madness seized the besieged, a
kind of intoxication of death drove them into danger,
and made them seek out the batteries where the fire
was fiercest. In sight of the enemy the artillerymen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
sang and danced in a kind of frenzy to the sound of
the bugles. A great shout of joy and affection greeted
the queen’s appearance under the hail of bullets on
the esplanades. She moved with a bold step, in the
easy grace of her nineteen years, dressed in a shining
bodice like a breastplate, her face smiling under the
plumes of her felt hat. Without moving an eyelash
as the bullets whistled by, she turned her encouraging
eyes on the soldiers; they inspired them like the
waving of banners, and beneath that gaze pride
seemed to magnify its wounds, while those who were
unscathed seemed to long for the glory of a crimson
stain. From time to time men with eyes burning
fiercely in blackened faces, with their clothes torn to
tatters, as though the jaws of a wild beast had rent
them&mdash;men covered with blood and powder rushed
up to her from the cannons, called her by name, and
kissed the hem of her skirt.</p>

<p>“Ah, how beautiful she was, and how worthy of her
throne!” exclaimed the prince, and his voice assumed
its manliest tones to celebrate her prowess. “Her
presence had a magnetic power over the soldiers.
When she was there, they all fought like lions. The
twenty-second of January was the most glorious day
of the siege, because she remained on the batteries
till nightfall.”</p>

<p>A pause followed, a moment of meditation, in
which each of us seemed to be contemplating the
ideal figure of the heroine on a field of ruin and
corpses.</p>

<p>“Tears were strange to her eyes!” said Violante<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
slowly, absorbed in her far-away memories. “When
at the last hour I saw her weep, I was overcome
with terror and surprise, as if some unexpected and
almost incredible thing had occurred. As she kissed
me, she watered my face with her tears.” After
another pause, she added&mdash;</p>

<p>“She wore a little green feather in her hat.”</p>

<p>She added again&mdash;</p>

<p>“She had a great emerald at her throat.”</p>

<p>She was sitting at my side, and a new emotion
swept over me as with an involuntary movement I
leant slightly towards her, and breathed the perfume
which I thought was growing stronger, and overpowering
the honeyed fragrance of the flowers. A
sudden aversion for all the people and things present
came over me; they gave me a feeling of impatience
and annoyance that was almost an aversion; they
seemed at that moment to be weighing on me and
oppressing me in quite a peculiar way. I looked
across with instinctive hostility at the prince’s cousin,
Ottavio Montaga, who sat at one end of the table, a
taciturn individual with something of the sinister look
of a mask, the symbol of a mysterious prohibition
not to be transgressed. I felt all the health, strength,
and passion in me rise in hatred against the sickness,
the sadness, against the mortal dulness by which this
wonderful creature was being consumed without a
chance of escape. The uneasiness which had
troubled my spirit after the successive apparitions
of the three different figures was now subdued, and
I believed myself to have set my choice on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
whom all the glory and solemnity of the past seemed
uniting to ennoble. Once more, it was she alone
who stirred my being as she had stirred it before
when she lifted her head at the cry of the hawk.</p>

<p>The prince said to me&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is singular, is it not, Claudio, that Violante
should be able to remember that time so clearly?
Don’t you think it very strange?”</p>

<p>Then, smiling with his previous gentle smile&mdash;</p>

<p>“Maria Sophia has never ceased to show partiality
for her. Knowing that she is passionately fond of
scent, she sends her quantities of essences every year
for her birthday. And she has never missed once, all
the time we have been here!”</p>

<p>He turned tenderly to his daughter&mdash;</p>

<p>“And now you could not get on without them,
could you?”</p>

<p>And to me he said, with a shade of sadness&mdash;</p>

<p>“She lives on them. You see, Claudio, how white
she is!”</p>

<p>I fancied that Anatolia whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>“She is dying of them.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we rose from table, Anatolia proposed going
down to the garden.</p>

<p>“Let us go and bask in the sun a little more!” she
suggested, pointing to a shaft of sunbeams which
shot down from the highest pane of a window where
the faded curtains were not drawn. “Who will come?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>By the movement her hand was lit up, turned golden
down to her wrist, and the rays slid through her
fingers like docile hair. “We will all come,” I replied.</p>

<p>Don Ottavio begged to be excused, and retired
(he seemed like an intruder among us); but the
prince laid his arm in Anatolia’s, as Antonello had
done before on the steps, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will come down to the quadrangle with you.”</p>

<p>As we passed through the vast reception hall, now
reduced to a disused anteroom, I noticed an old
sedan chair with the two poles still in it, as if a lady
had just descended from it, or was about to enter.</p>

<p>“Who uses the sedan chair?” I asked, as I stopped
to look at it.</p>

<p>“None of us,” answered Anatolia after a moment’s
hesitation, during which a shade of agitation passed
over every face.</p>

<p>“It is of the time of Charles <span class="allsmcap">III.</span>,” said the prince,
concealing his melancholy thoughts under a smile.
“It belonged to the Duchess of Cublana, Donna
Raimondetta Montaga, who was the most beautiful
lady of the court, and was praised as the greatest
beauty of the kingdom.”</p>

<p>“The design is excellent,” I remarked, approaching
it, for I was attracted by this piece of antiquity, which
seemed hardly yet dead, and to which the memory
of Donna Raimondetta gave a tender interest and
grace, so that I almost imagined as I looked that
she was alive again within it. “It is an exquisite
work of art, and wonderfully preserved.”</p>

<p>But I noticed a strange feeling of uneasiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
among my hosts, and that this uneasiness was caused
by the object I was looking at. And by virtue of
this mystery, I felt more strongly than before the
imaginary life dwelling within the precious wood.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the soul of Donna Raimondetta lives
inside,” I said lightly, and I could not resist the
desire to open the pane of glass. “It could not have
a more delicate casket. Let us see.”</p>

<p>As I opened it, a subtle odour reached my nostrils,
and I put my head inside, so as to breathe it better.</p>

<p>“What a scent!” I exclaimed, delighted with
the unexpected sensation. “Is it the Duchess of
Cublana’s perfume?”</p>

<p>And for a few seconds my imagination hovered in
the soft atmosphere created by the enchantment of
the ancient dame, picturing a little round mouth like
a strawberry, a powdered head-dress, and a brocade
dress stiffened by a hoop.</p>

<p>The sedan chair was scented like a bridal chest;
it was lined inside with willow-green velvet, and
decorated with a little oval mirror on each side;
without, it was all gilded and painted in the most
refined taste, the ceiling and jointings were enriched
with delicate carving, all the more harmonious and
pleasing to the eye from the veil thrown over them
by the hand of time; the whole was the work of a
graceful imagination and a skilled hand.</p>

<p>“Or perhaps it is you, Donna Violante,” I added,
“who have poured out one of your phials on this soft
velvet, as a homage to your famous ancestress?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not I,” she said, almost indifferently, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
if she had fallen back into her usual apathy, and was
again far away.</p>

<p>“Let us go now,” begged Anatolia, drawing on her
father, whose arm still rested in hers. “It is always
so cold in this room.”</p>

<p>“Let us go,” repeated Antonello, shivering.</p>

<p>From the top of the staircase we could already
hear the sound of the water; at first it sounded
hoarse, then gradually clearer and louder.</p>

<p>“Has the fountain been turned on?” asked the
prince.</p>

<p>“We turned it on just now,” said Anatolia, “in
honour of our guest.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice the play of the echo in the quadrangle,
Claudio?” Don Luzio inquired. “It is extraordinary.”</p>

<p>“Truly extraordinary,” I replied. “It is a wonderful
effect of sound. It is like a musician’s trick. I
think an attentive harmonist might discover the
secret of unknown chords and discords in it. It
would be an incomparable training for a delicate ear.
Is it not true, Donna Violante? You are on the fountain’s
side, against Antonello.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said simply, “I love and understand
water.”</p>

<p>“<em>Laudato si, mi Signore, per sor acqua.</em>” (Praised be
Thou, O Lord, for sister water.) “Do you remember
the canticle of St. Francis, Donna Massimilla?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the betrothed of Christ, with
her faint smile, colouring slightly. “I belong to the
Poor Clares.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>Her father’s look was a melancholy caress.</p>

<p>“<em>Suor Acqua</em>” (Sister Water), Anatolia called her,
caressing the soft bands of hair on her forehead with
her fingers. “Take that name.”</p>

<p>“It would be presumptuous,” replied the Poor Clare
with laughing humility.</p>

<p>She recalled to me with only a slight variation the
saying of the saint: <em>Symphonialis est aqua</em>.</p>

<p>We were all there close to the rushing fountain.
Each of the mouths was pouring out its voice through
a glass pipe like a curved flute. The lower shell was
quite full already, and the four sea-horses were up to
their bellies in water.</p>

<p>“The design is by Algardi, the Bolognese,” said the
prince, “the architect of Innocent <span class="allsmcap">X.</span>; but the sculpture
was done by the Neapolitan Domenico Guidi, the
same who executed the greater part of the relief of
Attila at St. Peter’s.”</p>

<p>Violante had drawn near the edge of the basin
again, and I gazed at the reflection of her figure in
the liquid element, whose continual tremor melted
the features as it rippled away round the horses’ hoofs.</p>

<p>“There is a tragic story in connection with this
fountain,” added the prince, “a story which has
become the source of some superstitious ideas.
Don’t you know it?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” I replied, “but tell it me, if you will.”</p>

<p>And I looked at Antonello, thinking of the lost
soul which tormented and terrified him at night. He
also was now looking intently at Violante’s reflection
as it trembled in the depths of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Here in this fountain Pantea Montaga was
drowned,” began Don Luzio. “In the time of the
Viceroy Peter of Aragon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But he interrupted himself&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will tell you the story another time.”</p>

<p>I saw that he shrank from calling up these
memories in presence of his daughters, and I did
not press him.</p>

<p>But shortly after, in the outer portico, as we paced
slowly up and down with his arm in mine, he returned
to the story; and all the time the sun blazed on the
series of terraces from which the tall white statues
of the Seasons looked over the tawny valley of the
Saurgo.</p>

<p>It was a mysterious secret drama of passion and
death, worthy of the weird stone cloister which had
fostered and exalted its violence in rapid alternation.
To me it signified the power which the genius of
places can exercise over the responsive soul, a power
by which every genuine feeling of the soul must concentrate
itself to the utmost degree of intensity
possible to human nature, in order to express its
whole force in a definite act with a certain result.</p>

<p>As I listened to the prince’s imperfect account, I
mentally reconstructed that hour of intense life which
produced the death of Pantea; and the midnight
crime appeared to me clothed in a beauty which was
the harbinger of profound thoughts.</p>

<p>At the close of the story Prince Luzio took leave
of me, saying: “I hope from this day you will treat
this house as your own. Whenever you like to come,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
you will be welcome, dear boy. So do not stay away
too long.”</p>

<p>It made me sad to see him enter the desolate
palace alone, so I went back a little way with him,
talking affectionately. We stopped again before the
fountain; and he made a motion of his hand towards
the basin, and in the chill, clear water I saw the fatal
beauty of Pantea and her curved white hands floating
in the water, like two magnolia petals, and her
soft hair fluttering under the horses’ hoofs.</p>

<p>“A legend grew up years afterwards,” said the
prince, smiling. “On moonless nights Pantea’s soul
sings on the summit of the fountain, while that of her
lover groans within the jaws of the stone beasts until
the dawn breaks.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The troublous joy of spring rose up in our faces as
we leant over the balustrade towards the sloping
garden. A kind of quivering atmosphere enveloped
us with the swiftness of a fever poison, and the sensation
was so strong as to paralyse the nerves. The
pupils of our eyes became fixed, our eyelids were
lowered as if sleep were gliding over us. My soul
within me was heavy like a cloud.</p>

<p>Anatolia remarked upon our mutual silence&mdash;</p>

<p>“Happiness is passing by.”</p>

<p>These sudden words of hers revealed to us the
secret of the anguish within us; she had expressed
the spirit of intense melancholy which pervaded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
earth awaiting the renewal of spring. “Happiness is
passing by!”</p>

<p>“Whose hands may arrest her?” I asked myself
sharply, in the blind agitation of my longing for love,
in the confused revolt of my deepest instincts.</p>

<p>The three sisters were leaning their elbows on the
stone parapet, their bare hands without rings stretched
out in the sun as in a golden bath: Massimilla with
fingers interlaced; Anatolia with one hand crossed
in the other so that her thumbs were uppermost;
Violante, pressing in hers some of the fading violets
out of her belt, and then letting them fall into space.</p>

<p>“Whose hands may arrest her?”</p>

<p>Anatolia’s looked the strongest and the most
sensitive. The firm outlines of the muscles and
tendons supporting the thumbs were clearly visible
beneath the skin. The tips of the thumbs wore rosy
nails for gems, with a half moon of white at the root
like a double onyx.</p>

<p>Had they not communicated a sense of their
generous power and practical kindness when first I
touched them? Had I not already felt a reviving
warmth in the hollow of her palm?</p>

<p>But Massimilla’s hands were like uncreated things,
like dream-shapes rather, so slender were they;
and so white, that the golden sunbeams failed
to gild them; and so symbolically familiar, that
in the broad daylight I could see again the dim
shadows of the dusky apse where first they appeared
to me, and see them hovering around the altar, last
relics of a form sunk back again into mystery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
and yet fitted&mdash;they alone&mdash;to enchant and caress
souls. Now with the interlacing of the clasped
fingers they symbolised the fetters of voluntary
slavery. “Here am I, thine own, bound by a tie
stronger than any chain. I will open my arms only
when it shall be thy good pleasure to release me.
Mine be it only to worship and obey, to obey and
worship,” was the confession which by these tokens
the devout maiden made to her ideal lord. And I
imagined her hands loosed and long scrolls of living
silence floating from them; just as from the hands of
the angels painted above and around altars there
float long streamers eloquently inscribed with verses,
and containing history within the mystic sense of the
written words. “Thus, oh Worshipper, mayest thou
encircle my wandering spirit within the living silence
of thy love! And I shall become unfaithful to
earth’s solitudes, to the solemn mountains, the
musical woods, the peaceful rivers, even to the starry
skies; for no sight on earth can elevate a man’s
spirit like the presence of a beautiful and submissive
soul. It is this which gives to the walls of a narrow
room the feeling of boundless space, like the votive
lamp which only increases the vast darkness of a
cathedral. And for this, I should desire to have thee
with me, sweet slave. He who meditates, surrounded
by silent adoration, feels the divinity of his own
thoughts and the creative power of a god.”</p>

<p>But the sublime hands of Violante, as they pressed
the essence out of the tender flowers and let them
fall crushed to the ground, were fulfilling an act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
which corresponded most perfectly, as a symbol, to
the characteristics of my ideal style: they extracted
the supreme flavour of life out of things, took from
them the utmost they could give, and then left them
exhausted. Was not this one of the most important
elements in my art of living?</p>

<p>And so Violante appeared to me as a divine and
incomparable instrument of my art. “Relation with
her is necessary to me that I may know and exhaust
the innumerable things which lie hidden in the depths
of the human senses, those things of which eternal
desire is the only revelation. The tangible body
encloses infinite mysteries which only the touch of
another body can reveal to him that is gifted by
Nature to understand them and religiously celebrate
them. And has not her body the sanctity and
magnificence of a temple? Does not her beauty
promise the highest revelations to my senses?”</p>

<p>Thus as before, when we ascended the steps, I felt
within me the attraction of the three complete
types, which promised to all my energies the joy
of manifesting themselves and of satisfying themselves
to the uttermost in perfect harmony. One
of them&mdash;in my dream&mdash;watched, her pure brow
radiant with prophecy, over the son of my soul
and my body; another, like the salamander in
the alchemist’s furnace, lived within the fiery circle
of my thoughts; and the third called me back to
the devout worship of the body and invited me to
learn in mysterious ceremonies how to live again the
life of the ancient gods. They all three seemed born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
to serve my ideal of perfection on earth. And the
duty of separating one from the other was as distasteful
to me as destroying some symmetry; it
irritated me, it seemed an injustice done by prejudice
and habit. “Why may I not take them all to my
home on a single day and adorn my solitude with
their threefold grace? My love and my art should
weave a different spell round each, build a throne for
each, and offer to each the sceptre of an ideal kingdom
peopled with shadows, where she would find her
immortal characteristics transfigured in their different
aspects. And since brevity is the most fitting attribute
of ambitious dreams and beautiful life, my love
and my art will be able to bring to these blessed ones
(but not to thee, Anatolia, who art fated to watch for
a long time) a harmonious death at the seasonable
hour&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>These thoughts of mine, burning like a soft delirium
in the early heat of the spring sun, were raining down
without ceasing on the hands of the maidens, when
Violante let the last of her crushed flowers fall, and
leant over to catch hold of the tips of the long
creepers which grew from the terrace below up to
the balustrade, and wreathed themselves round it.
She managed to break off a twig, and examined its
fibres to see if the spring sap had reached it yet.</p>

<p>“They are still asleep,” she said.</p>

<p>And so we bent over the sleep transparent already
of those pale sheaths, in which one of the greatest
of earth’s miracles was about to be worked, called
up before us by a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“You will see in a few months,” said Anatolia to
me, “they will all be covered with a green mantle;
all the trellises will throw shade.”</p>

<p>These plants were not the mothers of the grape,
but a kind of leafy vine with innumerable flying
tendrils, which spread like a piece of netting over
the wide surface of the wall and the trellises
down the steps. They looked more like worn-out
ropes than plants, torn as they were by the rain,
shrivelled by the sun, fragile as gossamer to behold.
And yet the approaching change made them appear
as mystical as the huge trunks of mountain forest
trees. Myriads of young leaves were about to burst
miraculously from the fibres of that lifeless rope.</p>

<p>“In autumn,” said Violante, “everything turns red,
a glorious red, and sometimes on sunny October days
the walls and steps seem to be hung with purple.
Then, indeed, the garden has its hour of beauty. If
you are here then, you will see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He won’t be here,” interrupted Antonello, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>“Why do you always say that?” I asked him with
gentle reproof; “who knows?”</p>

<p>“No one ever knows anything,” murmured Oddo in
that muffled voice of his, which I could only distinguish
from his brother’s by the movement of the lips.
“Who knows what may happen to us between this
and the autumn? Massimilla is the only one who is
safe; she has found her refuge.”</p>

<p>Perhaps there was a tiny drop of bitterness in the
last words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“Massimilla is going to pray for us,” said Anatolia
gravely.</p>

<p>The novice bent her head over her clasped hands,
and we were silent for a space, while a flood of vague
but overpowering feeling swept over us.</p>

<p>The clearness of the early spring afternoon paled
before that illuminating vision of the autumn purple
as we went down the steps, where a few hours before
the three princesses had appeared, as at the beginning
of a fairy tale, with a new-born smile on their lips
after a night of interminable anguish. That morning
hour already seemed as far away as the autumn
was near, to which&mdash;a dim presentiment told me&mdash;a
fate was leading me swift as lightning. And when
I pictured the purple foliage on the bare branches,
I also foresaw a shadow of deep mourning fall on
the faces of the three sisters.</p>

<p>And once more the sentiment of death impassioned
and elevated my soul till all things were reflected in
it transfigured by poetry. And in the splendour of
the spring air these frail beings seemed to me “marvellously
sad,” like the women in the vision of the
Vita Nuova, which Massimilla had recalled to my
memory among the almond blossom and the ancient
mirrors. And I felt as if the ardent spirit possessed
me that burns in the pages of that book, where the
youthful Dante shows how his soul could be shaken
to its very foundations, and exalted to the height of
sorrowful madness by imagining the death of Beatrice,
and gazing on her face through the funeral shroud.
“Weeping,” I said within myself. “Certainly it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
sometime come to pass that the very gentle Beatrice
will die.... And a great fear fell upon me, and
I imagined that some friend should come to me and
say: 'Dost thou not know? Thy marvellous lady
has departed from this world....’ Then my heart
that was so full of love said unto me: 'It is true that
our lady lieth dead’ ... and so strong was this
idle imagining that it made me to behold my lady
in death....” Did not the force of this ineffable inner
beauty come to me from a similar fancy?</p>

<p>A splendid nobility flowed from every action of
these maidens, doomed to die. It lit up the outward
things among which they moved. And never again
perhaps did I see them in so much light and shade.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we had reached the foot of the steps,
and entered a glade surrounded by the green ruins of
a box-wood bower, Anatolia paused and asked me&mdash;</p>

<p>“Would you like to see the whole garden? Perhaps
you might find some memories in it.”</p>

<p>As if she wanted to proclaim her power, Violante
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“As you enjoy the music of the water, I will take
you to see my seven fountains.”</p>

<p>And Massimilla, with her shy gentleness&mdash;</p>

<p>“In return for the almond blossom, I will show you
a white hawthorn which came out last night over
there.”</p>

<p>I felt as though they were speaking of their most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
intimate possessions, and, like the virgin of Fontebranda,
intended to say: “We are ourselves a garden.”</p>

<p>As I could not express what I felt, I said only
empty words.</p>

<p>“Show me the way, then,” I said; “I am sure to
come across some memories, at any rate of my early
reading, which used to be fairy tales.”</p>

<p>“Poor fairies without wands!” observed Oddo,
taking Anatolia’s hand with a caressing gesture.</p>

<p>And in the eyes of the maidens were smiles full of
despair.</p>

<p>Then Violante led us through a labyrinth.</p>

<p>We walked among evergreens, among ancient box-trees,
laurels, myrtles, whose wild old age had forgotten
its early discipline. In a few places here and
there there was some trace of the symmetrical shapes
carved once upon a time by the gardener’s shears;
and with a melancholy not unlike his who searches
on marble tombstones for the effigies of the forgotten
dead, I noted carefully among the silent plants those
traces of humanity not altogether obliterated. A
bitter-sweet odour hung round our path, and from
time to time one of us, as if wishing to weave afresh
an unravelled web, would reconstruct some memory
of our far-off childhood. And now the shadow of
my mother rose pure and clear before me, and seemed
to feed upon all the things which our hearts exhaled
in the broken silences, and she never left Anatolia’s
side, thus showing me her preference. And a bitter-sweet
odour hung over our melancholy.</p>

<p>Violante stopped and asked me, almost with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
same look and in the same tone as when she spoke
to me at the window&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you hear?”</p>

<p>“Now we are in your kingdom,” I said to her,
“because you are the queen of the fountains.”</p>

<p>The hoarse song of the water came to us through
a high myrtle hedge as we stood in a little meadow
strewn with daffodils, and guarded by a statue of
Pan green with moss. A delicious softness seemed to
spring in my veins from the soft turf my feet pressed,
and once again the sudden joy of living took away
my breath. At the same time, the presence of the
two brothers oppressed me, and pity for them grew
stronger. “Ah, how I could stir your sealed-up souls
to the very depths!” I thought, as I looked at the
three prisoners. “How I could quicken into anguish
the troubled feelings within you!” And I pictured
the delight of enjoying these fresh souls full of the
sap of life, rare fruits which had slowly ripened in
the garden of self-knowledge, and were here still
intact to slake my thirst. And my regret was the
greater, because I knew that never again could I
renew that unique charm of first acquaintance
between beings whose destinies are fated to be
united; that unique and fleeting charm, in which
are mingled marvel, and expectation, and presentiment,
and hope, and a thousand indefinable things
which partake of the nature of dreams, vain things
indeed, yet issuing from the most sacred depths of life.</p>

<p>Everything looked soft and rich through the transparency
of the amber air, and everywhere thoughts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
of beauty worthy of being gathered sprang into flower,
and the noblest flowered at the feet of the desolate
princesses, where I imagined myself stooping to gather
them. And I imagined the delight of caressing and
troubling those souls while wandering through the
cloistered garden, over whom the phantoms of the
ancient seasons seemed to be weaving a veil of poetry&mdash;a
veil into which were woven with almost invisible
threads strange figures of unknown beings laughing
and weeping in the alternations of joy and sorrow.</p>

<p>In every one of these fountains was there not a
Pantea singing, the pure victim of a wicked and
sublime passion? Certainly an extraordinary feeling
came over me when Violante led me beyond the
myrtles into the long alley enclosed between the
shrubbery and the eastern wall. Here reigned that
mysterious spirit which fills such lonely spots as
tradition tells us were wont to be the meeting-place
of lovers, celebrated for the tragic splendour of their
fate. The statues, the pillars, the very trunks of the
trees wore the aspect of things which have been witnesses
and accomplices of a great human passion, and
perpetuate the memory of it to all time. The deep
injuries of devouring time and the inclement seasons
had given to the outlines of the stone that expression,
I might almost say that eloquence, which ruins alone
possess. Noble thoughts seem to rise from the broken
lines.</p>

<p>And I imagined the delight of disclosing my
magnificent dream here to the three <em>blessed ones</em> who
alone could transform it into living harmony; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
imagined the delight of talking of love in that very
place where the virtue of so many symbols united to
raise the soul above the common griefs of humanity
and expand it in the supreme heaven of beauty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We were walking slowly, pausing from time to
time, and speaking to hide the uneasiness which
troubled us; Oddo and Antonello seemed tired, they
lingered a few steps behind and were gloomily silent.
And I felt as though the shadows of sickness and
death were behind me.</p>

<p>My fervour had cooled. I felt the crudeness of
the contrast between my impetuous eagerness and
the miserable necessity which clung fast to my side,
and was around me everywhere in that great cloister
full of forgotten and perishing things. I felt that
each one of those beings who in that very same
hour had been so often illuminated by my intellect
and transfigured by my passion, still kept her secret
intact, and that the language of her form could not
reveal it to me. As I looked at them, I saw each
far away from the other, each a stranger to the
other, each with an unfathomed thought between
her brows, each with an unfathomed sentiment in her
heart. I was about to go away and return to my
solitude; our day was near its end. What new
things had that first intercourse aroused in their
souls, weary with the long monotony of sorrow,
which had ceased perhaps to be brightened by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
ray of hope in the unforeseen? Under what aspect
had I appeared to each? Had their longing for love
and happiness yearned towards me with an uncontrollable
impulse, or did a suspicious incredulity like
that of their two brothers hinder them from trusting
me?</p>

<p>They were walking thoughtfully by my side, and
even when they spoke they seemed so deeply absorbed,
that more than once I was on the point of asking:
“What are you thinking about?” And a violent
desire arose in me to extort from them the secret
they were holding so close; and the bold words
which can suddenly unlock a closed heart, and
surprise the most secret pain and force it to confession,
rose to my lips. But at the same time a pitiful
tenderness moved me almost to ask their pardon for
the pain they might be suffering at my hand, and for
a sharper pain which they were to suffer in the future.
The necessity of choice presented itself to me as a
cruel trial, a cause of sorrow and inevitable sacrifices.
Did I not feel a vehement anxiety filling up the
pauses in our restless conversation?</p>

<p>“Oh, when summer comes!” sighed Violante, lifting
up her eyes to the spreading umbrella pines. “In
summer I spend the whole day here alone with my
fountains. And it is the time of the tuberoses!”</p>

<p>Gigantic pines with straight round stems like the
masts of a vessel grew at equal distances in a row
along the wall of the cloister and protected it with
their thick cupolas. Between stem and stem, like
the spaces between columns, were niches hollowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
in the wall and inhabited by nude statues or robed
figures in calm attitudes, their blind divinity calling
up visions of the past. At equal distances the seven
fountains projected in the shape of little temples;
each one composed of a wide basin in which deities
sitting on the brink or leaning on the urn of water
gazed at their own reflection framed between the two
pairs of columns which supported a pediment carved
with a couplet. Opposite them rose the great myrtle
hedge, a mass of green only broken by the white
pensive statues. And the damp ground was almost
entirely covered with moss as soft as velvet, which
rendered our steps noiseless and heightened the
sweetness of the mystery.</p>

<p>“Can you read the verses?” asked Violante, as she
saw me intent on deciphering the letters cut in the
stone, and effaced here and there by mould and
cracks. “I once knew what they meant.”</p>

<p>They said: “Hasten, hasten! Weave garlands of
fair roses to girdle the passing hours.”</p>

<p class="p1 center small1">
PRÆCIPITATE MORAS, VOLUCRES CINGATIS UT HORAS<br />
NECTITE FORMOSAS, MOLLIA SERTA, ROSAS.</p>

<p class="p1">It was only the ancient precept, sweetened by
rhyme, which for centuries has incited men to enjoy
the pleasures of our brief life, has kindled the kisses
on lovers’ lips, and multiplied the number of goblets
at the banquet. It was the old voluptuous melody,
modulated on the new instrument which an industrious
monk had fashioned in the shape of a dove’s wing
out of the various reeds left in the forsaken garden of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
Pan, and bound together with the wax of votive
lights and the threads of old altar linen.</p>

<p>“The fountain gleams and babbles; and saith to
thee in its splendour: 'Rejoice!’ and in its murmur
speaks of Love.”</p>

<p class="p1 center small1">
FONS LUCET, PLAUDE, ELOQUITUR FONS LUMINE: GAUDE.<br />
FONS SONAT, ADCLAMA, MURMURE DICIT: AMA.<br />
</p>

<p class="p1">The rugged rhymes with their eternal commentary
of running water threw a vague spell over my spirit.
I could hear in those echoes the veiled accents of the
melancholy which adds an indefinable grace to
pleasure, and by troubling it gives it greater depth.
No less soft and sad were the divine youthful figures
that stretched their bare limbs over the margin in
curves as graceful as those of the mirror into which
they had so long been gazing.</p>

<p>“Weep here, ye lovers who come to slake your
thirst. Too sweet is the water. Season it with the
salt of your tears.”</p>

<p class="p1 center small1">
FLETE HIC OPTANTES, NIMIS EST AQUA DULCIS, AMANTES<br />
SALSUS, UT APTA VEHAM, TEMPERET HUMOR EAM.<br />
</p>

<p class="p1">Thus the gentle fountain, envying the savour of
tears, pointed out to the joyous the subtle art of
imparting a touch of bitterness to the fullest enjoyment.
“It is well to mix among the roses some dewy
flower of the deadly hellebore, scarcely distinguishable
from the rest of the garland, so that thus redeemed
the head may from time to time be bent.” It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
seemed as if step by step, on that long Way of Love,
enjoyment became more collected, wiser, and yet
more passionate. The liquid mirrors invited lovers
to lay down heads heavy with dreams, and to gaze at
their own reflections, until, having at last attained to
perceiving in them only symbols of unknown beings
risen into the light from an inaccessible world, they
may better realise the presence of the unspeakably
strange and remote in their own lives. “Lean over
to your reflections that your kisses may be doubled
by the mirror.”</p>

<p class="p1 center small1">
OSCULA JUCUNDA UT DUPLICENTUR IMAGINE IN UNDA<br />
VULTUS HIC VERO CERNITE FONTE MERO.<br />
</p>

<p class="p1">Was not that simple action a token revealing a
hidden thing? The two lovers bending over the
reflection of their caress unconsciously figured the
mystic power of voluptuous enjoyment, which consists
in banishing for a few moments from our souls the
unknown man whom we all carry hidden within us,
and thus rendering him as remote and strange as a
phantom. Does not the dim vagueness of such a
sentiment perhaps increase the delirium and produce
the terror of lovers who in the mirrors of deep alcoves
admire the reflection of their mutual caresses repeated
by figures in their own likeness, yet immeasurably
unlike and remote in their supernatural silence?
With a confused consciousness of the extraordinary
alienation taking place within them, they think they
have found an enlightening symbol of it in those
outward images, which analogy leads them no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
to consider as visible objects, but as inexplicable
forms of life, and finally as visions of death.</p>

<p>This was the vision called up by the last of the
musical fountains, as Violante’s face bent over it and
the shadow of the pines fell slowly like a dark
blue veil. “Here did Pleasure and Death admire
their united reflection, and their two faces were fused
into one.”</p>

<p>A soft white cloud passed by and veiled the sun,
and the air became softer still; it was like transparent
milk into which some perfume had been
emptied. And the cadence of the Latin couplets
rang in my ears as we walked through enclosed
meadows yellow with daffodils, where one could
imagine the scenes of a pastoral <em>fête</em> held under
tents wreathed with garlands. On the base of a
statue of a nymph who had lost both her arms was
carved the emblem of the Arcadian Academy: the
fountain with seven pipes within a laurel wreath.</p>


<p>“Were you not here this morning?” I said to
Violante, as I recognised her close by the box-wood
arch under which she had first appeared to
me.</p>

<p>She smiled, and I thought a momentary flash of
colour passed over her cheeks. Only a few hours
had passed, and I was amazed to find how the exact
notion of time had escaped me. That short interval
seemed full of confused events which gave it, to my
consciousness, a deceptive length without any fixed
limits. I was not yet able to sound the gravity of
the life I had lived since the moment I had put foot
in the cloister; but I felt that some dim change,
fraught with incalculable results, was being worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
within me quite apart from my own will; and I
thought that, after all, the presentiment of the morning
on the lonely road had not been vain.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t we sit down?” asked Antonello
almost entreatingly. “Are you not tired yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let us sit down,” assented Anatolia, with her
usual gentle condescension. “I am a little tired too.
It is the spring air.... What a smell of violets!”</p>

<p>“But where is your white hawthorn?” I exclaimed,
turning to Massimilla to show her that I had not
forgotten her offer.</p>

<p>“It is a long way off still,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Down there.”</p>

<p>“Massimilla has her hiding-places,” said Anatolia,
laughing. “When she hides no one can find her.”</p>

<p>“Like a little ferret,” I added.</p>

<p>“And then,” she continued playfully, “she alludes
every now and then to some small wonder known to
herself alone, but she does it cautiously, keeping her
secret to herself, without giving in the least bit to our
curiosity. To-day with her white hawthorn she has
made you the object of special favour.”</p>

<p>The novice kept her eyes turned downwards, but
laughter quivered on her eyelashes and lit up her
whole face.</p>

<p>“Some day,” the kind sister went on, pleased to
have called up the unwonted ray, “some day I will
tell you the story of the hedgehog and the four little
blind hedgehogs.”</p>

<p>Then Massimilla burst into such clear youthful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
laughter, which clothed her in such unusual freshness,
that I stood amazed as if a miracle of grace had
taken place.</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t listen to Anatolia!” she said, without
looking at me. “She is laughing at me.”</p>

<p>“The story of the hedgehog and the four little
blind hedgehogs!” I said, drinking in with delight
this sudden vein of gaiety which crossed our melancholy.
“But you are a very pattern of Franciscan
perfection! We must add another little flower to the
<em>Fioretti</em>: 'How Sister Water tamed the wild hedgehog
and gave it a nest that it might multiply,
according to the command of our Creator!’ Tell
me, tell me the story.”</p>

<p>The Clare laughed with her dear Anatolia, and the
subtle feeling of joy spread to Violante also and to
the two brothers, and for the first time that day we
were conscious of our youth.</p>

<p>What words can express the sweet strangeness of
sudden laughter unlocking the lips and shining in the
eyes of the sorrow-stricken? The first amazement
of it lingered in my soul and seemed to cover all the
rest with a veil. The unusual emotion which had
stirred Massimilla’s slender breast took possession of
me and disturbed the outlines of previous impressions
or melted them away altogether. The half-closed
mouth of the ecstatic saint was suddenly filled with a
silvery rush of sound, just as she was about to let
scrolls of silence fall from the motionless palms of her
hands.</p>

<p>Nothing save the sound of that laughter could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
have conveyed to me the depth of the unapproachable
mystery which each of the virgins bore within
herself. Was it not a chance sign of that instinctive
life lying dormant like a heaped-up treasure in the
very roots of their physical existence? And did not
that hidden tenacious life, weighed down and yet not
crushed by the knowledge of so much sorrow, contain
within it the germs of numberless energies? As a
spring pours on the dry rock the tokens of secret
moisture underground, even so the beautiful sudden
laugh seemed to rise from that fount of natural joy
which the most miserable being still preserves in the
depths of his own unconsciousness. And thus above
my emotion rose a proud and loving thought: “I could
make thee a creature of joy.”</p>

<p>And then my eyes armed themselves with new
curiosity; and I was assailed by an anxious desire to
look, to gaze at, and observe the three princesses
more attentively, as if I had not seen them truly
before. And once more it struck me what a complicated
enigma of lines every feminine form is, and how
difficult it is <em>to see</em>, not only the soul but the body.
Those hands, for instance, on whose long, slender
fingers I had placed my subtlest dreams like invisible
rings, already seemed different to me, and appeared as
the receptacles of infinite nameless forces from which
marvellous generations of new things might arise. And
some strange analogy led me to imagine the anxiety
and horror which filled that young prince, who, imprisoned
in a dark place and obliged to choose his
own destiny at the hands of silent messengers, passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
the whole night in feeling the fatal hands which
were stretched out to him in the darkness. Hands
in the darkness&mdash;what more fearful image of mystery
can there be?</p>

<p>The bare hands of the three princesses rested in
the light; and looking at them, I thought of the
infinite number of uncreated gestures contained in
them, and of the myriads of leaves bursting out in
the garden.</p>

<p>Anatolia smiled as she saw my intent look.</p>

<p>“Why are you looking so attentively at our hands?
Are you a palmist?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am a palmist,” I answered in jest.</p>

<p>“Then tell us our fortunes.”</p>

<p>“Show me your left hand.”</p>

<p>She held out her palm, and her sisters did the
same. And I bent over them, pretending to explore
the lines of life, of fate, and of happiness in each.
“What are your fortunes?” I thought meanwhile as
I looked at these three fair hands stretched out as
if to receive or offer, and in the pause my trouble
was fed by the thousand unexpressed and inexplicable
things generated by the silence. “Possibly
even the iron magnet of fate may be subject to those
sudden changes which affect the pointing of the
magnetic needle in the compass. Possibly all the
energies of will that I feel within me, both clear and
confused, are already exercising their transforming
power; and the deviating fortunes may be tending
towards a final event which shall work out my good.
But possibly also I may be the sport of an illusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
born of my pride and confidence, and my present
state may be only that of a prisoner among
prisoners.”</p>

<p>Great was the silence during this pause; it was
such that the perception of the immensity of the
voiceless things embraced by it terrified me. The
sun was still under a veil. Suddenly Antonello
started and turned quickly towards the palace as if
some one had called him. We all looked at him
anxiously, and he looked at us with a wandering
gaze. The sisters laid down their hands.</p>

<p>“Well?” Anatolia asked me, with a shadow of
preoccupation on her brow. “What have you read?”</p>

<p>“I have read,” I replied, “but I cannot reveal.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she said, recovering her smile. “Is what
you know so terrible?”</p>

<p>“It is not terrible,” I said; “indeed, it is joyful.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Really.”</p>

<p>“For all of us or only for one?”</p>

<p>I hesitated an instant. Did she not penetrate into
my perplexity with her question and remind me of
the necessary choice.</p>

<p>“You won’t answer!” she added.</p>

<p>“For all of you,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Even for me?” asked Massimilla dreamily.</p>

<p>“Even for you. Are you not going to take the
veil by your own choice? And are you not sure of
attaining the blessedness which compensates for total
renunciation?”</p>

<p>As I looked straight into her eyes, she flushed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
colour that seemed almost violent contrasted with her
pallor.</p>

<p>“'Be thou, be thou that fragrant flower which thou
oughtest to be, spreading its fragrance abroad in the
sweet presence of God!’ Saint Catherine wrote that
for you.”</p>

<p>“You know Saint Catherine!” said the little novice,
her eyes shining with wonder through her blushes.</p>

<p>“She is my favourite saint,” I added, glad to see
her astonishment, and tempted by the pleasure of
disturbing and dazzling her soul, which seemed to me
to be eager and easily shaken. “I love her for her
purple hue. In the Garden of self-knowledge she is
like a rose of fire.”</p>

<p>The betrothed of Jesus looked at me almost
incredulously; but the desire of questioning and
listening was painted in her face, and the line of
attention cast already a faint shadow on her brow.</p>

<p>“The book I had with me this morning,” she said,
with a little tremble in her voice as if she were revealing
some intimate confidence, “was a volume of her
letters.”</p>

<p>“I noticed that like a good Franciscan you put a
blade of grass in your page for a mark. But that
book contains another mark. The grass in it burns
on the edge of a furnace. The essence of her soul is
all in those words of hers: 'Fire and blood united
by love!’ Do you remember them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Massimilla,” interrupted Oddo, laughing, “you
may dismiss your spiritual father. Now you have
found the true guide to the way of perfection!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>We were sitting on the edge of an empty tank
which had no doubt been an ancient fish-pond; now
it was almost entirely filled with soil, and taken
possession of by wild plants, among which violets
were hidden&mdash;in great numbers, to judge by their
great fragrance. Close by was the broken-down wall
of box-wood, breathing out the same aroma from its
depths as had met me on my first entrance into
the garden. I could see the deserted alley with its
mutilated statues and widowed urns through the
thin parts of the shrubs and through the arches.</p>

<p>“Is the day yet fixed for you to enter the convent?”
I asked Massimilla.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” she replied, “but it is almost sure to
be before Easter.”</p>

<p>“Very soon then. Too soon!”</p>

<p>Antonello got up, suddenly seized by unbearable
agitation. We all turned towards him. He looked
at Anatolia with vague terror in his pale eyes. Then
he sat down again. An indefinable anxiety crept
over us; it seemed as if Antonello had imparted
some of his distress to us.</p>

<p>“This time yesterday we were in the orchard
among the almond blossom,” said Oddo, with a shade
of regret for a past pleasure in his voice.</p>

<p>Antonello’s words rose spontaneously in my mind:
“We must bring them here among the flowers.”</p>

<p>“We must all go back there some day,” I broke
out cheerfully, to destroy that strange atmosphere of
fear and anxiety which, for some unknown cause, was
increasing over our minds. “We must make the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
of this beautiful springtime. In a week the whole
valley will be in flower. I propose to go all over it,
up to Corace, to visit Scultro, Secli, Linturno....
How happy I should be if I might have your
company! Would you not like to come? Won’t
you set a good example, Donna Anatolia?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she said. “You offer us just what we
wish.”</p>

<p>“And you too, Donna Massimilla, will be allowed
the recreation. Saint Francis, as you know, composed
the canticle of the Sun in the cell of boughs
which Saint Clara had made for him in the monastery
garden. According to the ancient rule, the woods,
the rivers, the mountains, and the hills must be your
brothers and sisters. Travelling among them is like
making a votive pilgrimage.... And then in the
deserted city at Linturno there is the nave of a
church still standing; and a great Madonna in mosaic,
standing solitary under the canopy of the apse....
I always remember it. It is a thing one cannot
forget. Do you remember it, Antonello?”</p>

<p>Antonello started at the sound of his name.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” he stammered in a confused
voice.</p>

<p>And his poor drawn face expressed such suffering
that I could not speak.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, let us go, let us go,” he added, pretending
to have heard; and he rose, a prey to evident
agitation. He had the air of a maniac, he was so pale
and tottering. “Let us go away from here! Anatolia,
get up....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>He spoke quite low, as if he feared to be overheard
by some one in the neighbourhood. His tone filled
us with dread.</p>

<p>“Get up, Claudio. Let us go.”</p>

<p>Anatolia ran to him and took his hands.</p>

<p>“Here she is, here she comes!” he stammered,
quite beside himself, turning his pale eyes, diluted by
the hallucination, towards the alley. “Here she is!
Do you hear?”</p>

<p>Perplexed and troubled as I was, I thought at first
that he was terrified by some phantom called up by
his madness. But the sound of approaching steps
reached my ears also; and all at once I understood
as I saw the sedan chair appear between the walls
of box.</p>

<p>There we stood, dumb, motionless, holding our
breath as the strange convoy passed along. In the
icy silence which had fallen on us, like that surrounding
a bier, one could distinctly hear the poles
carried by the two servants creaking slightly in their
places.</p>

<p>Then through the open window of the chair, against
the background of green velvet, I saw the face of the
mad princess; it was unrecognisable, disfigured, and
swollen and bloodless, like a mask of snow; the hair
was piled on her brow like a diadem. Her great
black eyes blazed out of the opaque whiteness of her
skin from beneath the commanding arched eyebrows,
their extraordinary splendour maintained perhaps by
the continual hallucination of fantastic pomp and
luxury. Her double chin hung down over the necklace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
round her throat. And this pale inert mass
suggested to my imagination the dream-figure of
some Byzantine empress of the time of a Nicephorus
or a Basil, lying in her golden litter.</p>

<p>“There, she sees us; she is stopping, she is getting
out, and coming towards us,” I fancied with growing
uneasiness, half expecting some proof of the reality of
what seemed to me an unreal apparition on the point
of vanishing and of entering the void again like a
dream when one wakes. “There, she is calling some
one, speaking to them, asking who I am, questioning
me....” In the silence I heard in imagination the
sound of her voice, the dialogue between the children
doomed to an inhuman sacrifice, and the mother
whose madness had transported her into another
world; a world into which she was inevitably drawing
them all, one after the other. And in my horror I
understood the deep shudder of instinctive repugnance
that had passed over Antonello as she approached,
something like the shudder which runs through the
folded flock at the approach of the wild beast who
is going to devour them.</p>

<p>But she passed by without noticing us, without
moving an eyelid, and vanished among the ancient
box-trees. Two maids, dressed in grey like Béguines,
pale with weariness, silent and sad, walked close
behind the sedan chair; their arms hung at their
sides, and swung at every step like the rosaries
hanging from their waists, cold and inanimate.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>
</div>

<p>As I rode back to Rebursa alone, I could see
before me the pale swollen face of the Princess
Aldoina, and the gloomy fatigue of the servants, and
the two grey shadows following the chair, and all
the details of the strange procession. Some essential
part of me had been left behind in the great cloister,
but still I felt in my inmost being the joy of being
alone again.</p>


<p>I recalled once more to my mind the gestures
of farewell at the gate, the marvellous depth in
the eyes of the prisoners, and the dreamlike view
of the garden vanishing away behind the three
beautiful forms. And at the same time all the other
phantoms of the intense life I had lived in those few
hours crowded into my soul like a store of varied
and disordered riches, gathered up that they might
be rearranged for the adornment of my secret
kingdom.</p>

<p>“What opulence!” said the Dæmon, appearing to
me, not without joy and pride. “What magnificence
in a single day! Thou couldest not have better
served thine end, which is to give life to everything,
to extract life from the most barren things. Now,
dost thou acknowledge the wisdom of my morning
admonition? Dost thou not bless the sternness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
thy long restraint, since it now yields thee this
intoxicating fruit? Thy power of poetry, like thy
will, has no limit. Everything that is born and
exists around thee is born and exists by reason of
the breath of thy will and thy poetry. And thou
art nevertheless living in a very real order of things,
because nothing is more true in the world than the
things of poetry.”</p>

<p>The day was sinking over the undulating valley of
the Saurgo, and the slanting rays turned the brown
fields into gold, while the light clouds sat in a circle
on peaks of rock resembling the highest seats in an
amphitheatre. They sat there in feminine attitudes,
waiting for the evening to robe them with purple.</p>

<p>“Now, thou couldest make even salt bear fruit,”
said the Dæmon to me. “Wherever thy spirit
turns, abundance springs up. But thou hast with
thee also the favour of fortune; thou hast entered
the unknown and unforeseen not as one feeling his
way and exploring with hesitation, but as one who
is expected and called to gather in the harvest on a
field where the richest fruit awaits him&mdash;fruit still
intact, and ready to fall into his hands whenever
in sunshine or in shadow he pleases to stretch
them out. Thou hast entered a cloistered garden,
delicious and terrifying as the garden of the Hesperides.
Happiness has smiled to thee in three
shapes, standing between madness and death, like
statues of pure white marble between two black
columns. Is there not some meaning for thee in
that symbol?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Oh despot,” I replied, “there is surely some hidden
meaning in the symbol thou declarest to me, and I
shall discover it. But since the perfection of that
trinity attracts me, and since it is necessary for my
purpose that I should choose, I am perplexed in spirit,
and not without fear of being deluded like a common
mortal.”</p>

<p>And the Dæmon: “Not thy fears of the morning
alone, but those of the evening also are vain! Nor
is that thy only error; for before now, in the
presence of the blessed ones, after having composed
beautiful music out of the beauty of their bare hands
thou didst regret that thou couldest not carry them
all away at once to thy home; thou didst rebel
against the injuries of prejudice and custom. Now,
in thus doing, thou didst humble thyself, not only to
own the power of the laws of others, but also to
disown the power of thy own ideal, which alone is
sacred. Why dost thou aspire to the legitimate
possession of the body when the ideal figures already
adorn the house of thy dreams with their triple
grace? Thou couldest not remove the three prisoners
from their dungeon without breaking the enchantment
which transfigures them. Countless mysterious
waves of affinity flow between the depths of those
lives and the silent places where they have suffered
and awaited thee. Their grace, their desolation, and
their pride draw the fascination which enthralled
thee from the hidden virtue of innumerable elements.
Even so, noble plants, with their long roots subdivided
into myriads of fibres, absorb from the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
bosom of the earth those immortal energies which
are pressed towards the light by the rising force in the
stalk, and are crowned in the miracle of the flower
and the perfume. Canst thou, oh Poet, imagine
Eglae, Arethusa, or Iperthusa chased from their
garden? When Heracles, clothed with stars, penetrated
into the western paradise to rob its golden
apples, he forbore to carry away the daughters of
Night, for even his brutal soul felt that he would
have defaced, and perhaps destroyed, the heavenly
mystery of their beauty.”</p>

<p>“Oh despot,” I said then, “I am thinking of Him
who is to come.”</p>

<p>And the Dæmon: “It is well that this should be
always the sum of thy thoughts. But once before,
the necessity of choice appeared to thee as a cruel
trial, a source of sorrow and inevitable sacrifice, and
thy heart shrank from it. Reflect that there is no
goddess so worthy of being called upon to preside at
a birth as Sorrow. Nothing in the world is lost, and
wonderful things may sometimes be born of tears.
Reflect that the highest power of will does not manifest
itself in the readiness to choose from many things
offered, nor in the firmness which resists various
impulses, but rather in the art of giving the clearness
and dignity of acknowledged and directed powers to
the instinctive motions of nature. Reflect that there
is always some way of being equal to the event in
all the chances of this most uncertain life. There
was once a man who, beside a tyrant able by one
sign of his hand to condemn him to death, wore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
such a look, that bystanders doubted which of the two
was the master. Be thou like unto him, and handle
the events of life in a royal spirit.”</p>

<p>The dome of heaven was tinged with pale hyacinthine
blue, and the olive-trees reflected its calm
on their silver locks, which concealed the painful
contortions of their black trunks. The clouds on
the rocky peaks were not yet clothed in purple,
but in robes of more delicate hue, making them
droop; yet one here and there raised a proud head
among her companions and aspired to a crown of
stars.</p>

<p>“In the meantime compose thy music,” pursued
the Dæmon, “out of the wonderful things which
are born of affinity, and of the relations between
three perfect forms contemplated sincerely. In
their unison and surroundings there is a wonderful
language which is already as comprehensible to
thee as if thou hadst created it. Out of any one
of their outlines thou canst make the axis of a
world. They seem to impart to thee the joy of
continual creation and continual discovery, to help
thee to complete thy harmony with a part of thyself
unexpectedly revealed. They seem to pour into thee
again the life which ages ago they received from thee.
Hadst thou not enjoyed them even before they smiled
on thee? As thou stoodest in silence beside them,
was not thy soul within thee heavy as a cloud?”</p>

<p>“Oh despot,” I said, and felt my soul yearn with
infinite desire towards the garden from which the
harmonious twilight was bearing me away. “Oh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
despot, it is true; as I stood in silence beside them,
I felt stronger emotion than if I had loosed their
hair, or pressed my lips on their beautiful necks, and
I am still full of it. Yet, as the shadows fall, I would
fain return there secretly; and invisible to the eye, I
would lean my head on those virginal bosoms and
tarry there a long while, because I think that from
those bosoms there would flow over me in the cool
shadow a great sweetness and a great sorrow which
I shall never know.”</p>

<p class="p2">And I led them among the flowers.</p>

<p>They listened with visible emotion to the infinite
melodies of springtime, bending or turning sometimes
towards their own shadows, which preceded or
followed them like blue figures prostrated to kiss
the earth. A confused feeling of the joy of liberty
and hope shone at times in their dazzled eyes;
a voiceless word at times unclosed their lips, and
likened them to the brims of overflowing goblets.
And when they paused, I thought with inward intoxication
of the fulness of life which was suffocating
them.</p>

<p>The things that we said to each other from time
to time must have seemed futile to them also; but
they were enough to make us feel the depth of our
true life. A passing glance, a bend of the head, a
short pause, sufficed to stir to their depths those
abysses which the faint light of ordinary consciousness
rarely penetrates, while that which we were
saying seemed as far away to us as the deepest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
roots of trees are far from the murmur of the uppermost
branches.</p>

<p>Nothing could have equalled the strange beauty
of that stern country in full blossom. On the tawny
ground, shaggy as a lion’s mane, the pink-and-white
flowers suggested pictures of maidens lying trembling
on the vast hairy bosoms of legendary giants. The
rays of the sun played round the transparent petals
and gave them the dancing splendour of precious
stones. Here and there the polished ploughshares
with which the land had been turned up glittered
in dual radiance.</p>

<p>We realised the depth of our real life. And little
by little, by common consent, we forbore to utter
those empty words which had only served to break
the solemnity of the silence, and to disperse the
heavy cloud of dreams and thoughts which hung
over us. We were united by a clearer and more
intimate communion; an atmosphere of divination
such as the mystics breathe sprang up around us,
and without speaking we exchanged the profoundest
secrets. Sometimes we were so steeped in delight
that it surged from our eyes in a glance, and our
slightest gestures expressed, without actual contact,
all that is conveyed by the most lingering caress.
The petals which fell at our feet from the almost
motionless boughs, moved us strangely, like a confession
of languor on the part of the trees, and of a
delight in relieving themselves. The vines, all ready
to bud, bending over the earth in contorted, struggling
shapes, stimulated us with the example of a painful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
effort about to be changed into an intoxicating gift.
And in the frail petal and slight tendril we felt the
ideal virtue of the fragrant almond-oil and the flame
of oblivion given by the grape.</p>

<p>A sudden agitation seized me one day when I saw
a drop of blood on Violante’s hand, which had been
pricked by a thorn among the flowers of a snowy
hedge. Smiling, she withdrew the beautiful hand on
which the drop was rising; and as we chanced to be
at some distance from her sisters, and perhaps unobserved,
I felt a wild desire to press my lips upon
the blood and taste its sweetness. And the effort
I made to restrain myself was so great that I
trembled.</p>

<p>“Do you dislike the sight of blood?” she asked me
in a voice which dissimulation was not able to steady
or to make playful.</p>

<p>And as her eyes looked into mine I felt myself
turning pale, for I had an indefinable feeling within
me which can only be vaguely compared to an
immense wheel revolving with lightning-like speed
and suddenly brought to a standstill. Something
great was being resolved upon in that moment by
each of us; and although we preserved a composed
attitude with regard to each other, our inward attitude
was one of extreme tension preceding an irrepressible
outburst. Our two lives yearned towards each other
with their whole force.</p>

<p>Ah, shall I ever forget that burning silence trembling
with the invisible flight of a messenger bearing
the unspoken word? What power of oblivion will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
ever be able to efface from my memory that hand
beaded with blood, and that hill slope covered with
blossom?</p>

<p>Anatolia’s voice called to us in the distance, and
we moved on side by side. A sudden bodily weariness
and sadness had fallen upon us, as if we had just
passed from a long night of pleasure.</p>

<p>But there were moments also when my soul
inclined rather towards her who had called us, and
towards her who was about to depart. I rejoiced
in these changes of love, which did not dissipate
my energies, but stimulated them as wind fans the
flame. I seemed to have discovered a new set of perceptions;
the strangest and most diverse ones seemed
to combine spontaneously within me. Sometimes
they gave birth to such novel and beautiful music
that I felt on the point of being transfigured, and I
thought that my desire to become like unto the gods
was about to be realised.</p>

<p>I thought: “If ever there was a god who loved to
sit in the springtime beneath the flowering trees and
entice the hamadryads from their hiding-places to
caress them in his arms, he certainly never experienced
greater enjoyment than I feel in gathering up
the essential beauty of these delicious beings, and
mingling it together with the same ease with which
he might weave the diverse obedient locks of his
tree nymphs into a golden harmony.”</p>

<p>Thus at times I felt as though I were living in a
myth which the youth of the human soul created
under the skies of Hellas. The ancient spirit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
deity was abroad upon the earth, as it was when the
daughter of Rhea gave to Triptolemus the gift of ears
of corn that he might sow them in the furrows, and
that all men by him might enjoy the divine benefit.
The immortal energies which flowed through visible
things seemed always conscious of the old transfiguring
spirit that used to convert them into great symbols
of beauty for the enjoyment of men. Three in number,
like the Graces, the Gorgons, and the Fates,
were the maidens who moved with me through this
mysterious springtime. And I loved to compare
myself to the youth pictured on the vase of Ruvo,
who is enticing a winged genius across the threshold
of a myrtle grove. Over his head is written the
name Happiness, and three maidens surround him;
one bears in her hands a dish heaped up with
fruit, another is wrapped in a starry mantle, and the
third has the thread of Lachesis in her nimble
fingers.</p>

<p>One day we came by chance on a piece of enclosed
ground, which the peasant cultivators had, according
to the old heathen custom, dedicated to an oak-tree
struck by lightning.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful death!” exclaimed Violante, as
she leant over the oblong wooden fence which protected
it.</p>

<p>The lonely place was full of almost terrible
solemnity. The aspect of the altar which the
Latin priests consecrated with the sacrifice of a
white lamb must have been something like this.</p>

<p>“You are committing sacrilege,” I said to Violante.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
“This sacred enclosure cannot be touched without
profanation. Heaven punishes the transgressor with
madness....”</p>

<p>“With madness?...” she said, and drew away
with a kind of instinctive superstition; her action
gave an unexpected seriousness to my allusion to the
pagan belief.</p>

<p>In one flash I saw the pale, swollen face of her
mad mother, and Antonello’s wandering eyes, and I
heard again the tragic cry: “We are breathing her
madness”; and an icy sensation of fatality ran through
me.</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t be afraid!” I said involuntarily, only
deepening the shadow, perhaps, by thus clearly expressing
my regret for the remark which must have
seemed like a gloomy omen or a cruel presentiment.</p>

<p>“I am not afraid,” she replied, without smiling, as
she leant over the fence again.</p>

<p>Thus from an idle word was born a great shadow.</p>

<p>The stricken tree rose before us, hard and black as
basalt, its stony trunk torn open to the roots by a
rent which testified to the awfulness of vindictive
force. Its torn side was bare of branches, but there
were a few left at the top of the other side, flinging
the implacable despair of their gestures up to the
sun. At each corner of the enclosure was fixed a
ram’s skull with curved horns, bleached by the sun
and rain of numberless seasons. Everything was
motionless, dead, and sacred, and primeval in
appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>From time to time the cries of the hawks pierced
the blue sky.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The days passed by rapidly; they were days of
farewell to her who was about to depart.</p>

<p>“Gaze at the springtime with the whole strength
of your eyes,” I used to say to her, “for you will
never see it again, never again!”</p>

<p>I said also to her&mdash;</p>

<p>“Warm your hands in the sun, bathe them in the
sun, poor hands, for soon you will have to keep them
crossed on your breast, or hidden in the shade under
the brown woollen habit.” I would say as I showed
her a flower&mdash;</p>

<p>“Here is a miracle for which you ought to thank
Heaven. Think of the thousand legends contained
in the silver network of this blossom, of the hidden
relation between the number of petals and stamens,
of the slender threads which support the lobes of
the pistils, of this transparent robe, this web, these
valves and membranes covered with almost invisible
down, which enclose the mysterious agitation of the
seed vessels. Think of all the divine art revealed in
the structure of this living creation, gifted in its
fragility with infinite powers of love and fertility.
See the moving tracery of shadow which the trembling
leaves cast on the earth, and the same tracery
painted on the wall, to cheer your melancholy, in
rays now blue and now golden; and the little, white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
fingers at the tips of the pine branches; and the
drops of dew hanging from the beard of the oats;
and the delicate veins in the wings of the bee; and
the dazzling green of the dragon-fly; and the iridescent
colours on the dove’s neck; and the strange
shapes of lichen stains; and the holes in tree-trunks;
and the composition of crystals.... Store away all
these marvels under those eyelids of yours, which will
have to be lowered for so long before Christ crucified.
I don’t think there are any gardens in the old monastery
of Queen Sancia, only stone cloisters.”</p>

<p>“Why do you tempt me?” she used to ask. “Why
do you enjoy disturbing my weak will? Have you
been sent by God to try me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to disturb your will,” I replied, “but
only to give you brotherly advice, which may help
you to suffer less. I think that after you are buried,
when you cannot look out of the grated windows
without hurting your cheek against the bars&mdash;I think
that you who have grown up in a garden will have
to pass through a few weeks of furious impatience,
when all the visions of the open air will pass before
your memory. Then it will be inexpressible torture
to you if you cannot recall the exact details of the
tiny black and yellow speckles on the lizard’s back,
or the tender downy leaf which buds on the branch
of an apple-tree. I know the madness of such belated
curiosity. Once I was passionately fond of a
great Scotch deerhound my father had given me.
He was a magnificent beast, very graceful, and extraordinarily
well bred. When he died I was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
greatest misery; and it used to torment me strangely
that I could not exactly recall the precise shape of
the specks of gold in his brown eyes, and the grey
marks in his beautiful rosy mouth when one caught
a glimpse of it in a yawn or a bark. We ought,
therefore, to look with attentive eyes at everything,
especially at the creatures we love. Do you not love
the things I was speaking to you about just now? and
are you not about to leave them? Are you not about
to place a kind of death between them and you?”</p>

<p>She sat, the fingers of her hands clasped together,
holding within them the weary knee. Her delicate
grace was a little disturbed by the trouble she felt at
the ambiguity of my words, half serious and half
playful, half deceptive and half sincere. And speaking
in this way gave me the same pleasure as I
should have felt in ruffling the smooth bands of that
hair over which the silver scissors of the tonsure were
hanging. “<em>Tondeantur in rotundum....</em>” Still clear
in my memory was the fresh ring of the youthful
laugh rippling from her mouth at the closing hour of
that first day, and filling me with wonder. And it
pleased my fancy to group the pictures of all these
slight, many-coloured things around the novice, who,
in that already far-away February afternoon, had
showed me as a secret miracle the nightly blossoming
of her white hawthorn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I used to seek her as one seeks some good thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
which one knows to be ephemeral. She attracted me
like a pure figure of youth, turning to me with a
tearful smile on the threshold of a gloomy door,
through which she was about to pass, and be lost to
sight. I should like to have said to her sisters: “Let
me love her as long as she is of this world; let
me pour spices over her little feet!” During my
long visits it often happened that I was alone with
her, and could enter into spiritual converse with her
docile soul, ever anxious to obey. From time to
time Anatolia would disappear, when one or other
of the two grey maids came to summon her with
a look. There were some days when Violante
scarcely appeared at all. She seemed to avoid my
society, to look upon me with indifference, to have
fallen back into her usual apathy. The two brothers
could not stand the full light of the open air for very
long, and so I often found myself alone with the
little novice, sitting on a marble seat beneath the
statue of Summer in the outer court, or in the shadow
of the already verdant trellises over the steps, or on
the edge of the dried-up fish pond. I would say to
her&mdash;</p>

<p>“Perhaps you may have deceived yourself in the
choice of your Bridegroom, sweet sister. When you
hear the bishop saying, '<em>Ecce sponsus venit</em>,’ you will
tremble in your secret heart, and will expect a fair,
strong hand to be stretched out to you, and to gather
you up entirely, like water in the hollow of a palm;
for this is the sweet, powerful attitude which you
expect of your conqueror, and which is best suited to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
your flexibility, sweet sister. But perhaps you may
be deluded at the very foot of the altar. And if you
dare to lift your eyes, you will see, amid the burning
candles, the promised Bridegroom motionless, with
His pierced hands, and His head crowned with
thorns. You will feel obliged, sweet sister, to draw
out those cruel nails, driven in so deep. And terrible
strength will seem to be required to fulfil such an
action. And then the wounds will have to be dressed
with infinite patience, and with balsams made of
herbs only to be gathered on certain giddy heights,
where the air is too rarefied to breathe. And the
wounds once closed, the blood bursting from the
veins will have to be forced back into its proper
channels. And after the toilsome work has been
completed, perhaps the newly-healed hands will withdraw
altogether. To very few brides is it granted to
see them perfectly restored again; and even among
the elect there is scarcely one to whom on some
mystic evening is vouchsafed the supreme joy of feeling
herself altogether possessed, altogether folded
within the constraining clasp, as you desire to be....”</p>

<p>The submissive maiden murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>“God grant that I may be that one!”</p>

<p>“Ah, sweet sister,” I said to her, “only think what
immense strength that one must possess to revive a
dead hand and to draw it so ardently to herself!”</p>

<p>“I have not any strength, but I will ask it of the
Lord.”</p>

<p>“The Lord can only give you back the strength
you have given to Him, Massimilla.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“Be silent, please!” she implored. “I am afraid
your words are impious.”</p>

<p>“They are not impious; you need not fear listening
to them. Do you not remember the first lines of
the Commentary of St. Theresa? She speaks there
of a God imprisoned. Think what power is required
to enchain the Lord! You see, Sister Water, what
unceasing acts of strength are required of the Bride
who is sung in the Antiphons and Responses. That
is why, as I have a brotherly anxiety for you, I want
at least to prepare your soul for the bitterness of disillusion.
Do not lull it too much with the promises
of the Psalms! There is, I think, some magnificent
joyous promise in the verses you have learned, '<em>Veni,
Electa mea....</em>’ 'Rise up, my love, my fair one, and
come away. For lo! the winter is past ... the
voice of the turtle is heard in our land ... the vines
with the tender grapes give a good smell.’ Ah, the
Latin of the Psalms is incomparable in producing a
picture of the intoxication of love sinking under
suffocating wealth. Some of the verses seem to drop
with fragrant oil like the hair of slaves, or to be heavy
and glittering as nuggets of gold. When the bishop
places the crown of virginal merit on your head, your
lips will have to pronounce wonderful words&mdash;words
in which I see and feel some mysterious weight and
splendour. '<em>Et immensis monilibus ornavit me.</em>’
Wonderful words! Are they not?”</p>

<p>She was looking at me now with such passion that
all her little soul trembled like a tear on her eyelashes,
and by merely bending forward I could have
drunk it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps I may be hurting you a little,” I went on.
“But I see such dreams burning in the depths of your
eyes that I am afraid for you, sweet sister; for the
life for which you are preparing yourself cannot be in
accordance with your dreams or with your nature.
What is awaiting you is a monotonous life, always
the same, almost torpid, all mapped out by the
unchangeable Rule, in the old convent of Queen
Sancia, which has been the grave of more than one
Montaga, and of more than one Cantelma. There is
a picture in my memory of those Poor Clares one
Ash Wednesday. When I was in Naples, the
Angevin Church of Santa Chiara had an attraction
for me, not only because some of my ancestors lie
there, not only because there one may envy the Duke
of Rodi his sleep in the pagan sarcophagus of Protesilaus
and Laodamia, but also because there with
closed eyes one can absorb the poetry diffused by
the beautiful names of dead women. There is Maria,
Duchess of Durazzo and Empress of Constantinople,
there is the Princess Clemenza, there is Isotta d’Altamura,
and Isabella di Soleto, and Beatrice di Caserta,
and that delicious Antonia Gaudino, who is very like
you, as she softly sleeps in marble under a veil which
Giovanni da Nola must have borrowed from the
youngest of the Graces. I have a picture in my
memory of the Poor Clares on Ash Wednesday.
Behind the high altar there is a great black grating,
all covered with spikes, enclosing the convent choir;
and through it one can see the rows of stalls where
the sisters sit, while on this side of the barrier the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
bishop, served by a Capuchin, is seated with a silver
basin full of ashes in his hands. A shutter is opened
in the grating, and one by one the Clares come and
kneel at it. The bishop thrusts his feeble arm through
the hole and marks their foreheads one by one with
the sign of the cross. As each has been signed she
rises and returns to her stall like a ghost, brushing the
pavement with silent feet shod in felt. It all goes on
in silence, and it is all icy like the ashes. Ah, sweet
sister, when you too have been frozen like that, who
will there be to warm your little soul?”</p>

<p>“Who warmed the soul of St. Clara and made it
glow?” objected the novice, rousing herself to escape
defeat, while the colour rose in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“A man: St. Francis of Assisi. You cannot think
of the Sister of St. Damian except on her knees at
the feet of Francis. A religious painter has pictured
her in the act of exchanging a kiss with the seraphic
father. And think of the long idyll woven between
the hermitage of St. Damian and the Portiuncula;
think of that week of passion, sorrow, and pity passed
in the convent garden, under the shadow of the olives,
during a summer of great drought, when Clara used
to drink the tears from the almost blind eyes of
Francis; think of the converse between the two
mystical lovers which preceded that ecstasy whence
the Song of the Creatures burst like a flash of light.
You have the <em>Fioretti</em> beside you. Very well, read
over the chapter in which it tells 'How St. Clara ate
with St. Francis.’ Never was wedding banquet lit
up by more radiant torches of love. Here it is: 'The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
men of Assisi and Beltona, and of all the country
round about, saw that Santa Maria degli Angeli, and
the whole place, and the forest round about it, were
burning brightly, and it seemed as if a great fire were
devouring the church and the place and the forest
together; whereupon the men of Assisi ran thither
with great haste to put out the fire, believing that in
very truth everything was burning. But when they
reached the place and found no fire at all, they
entered in and found St. Francis with St. Clara.’
You see now, sweet sister, how the patroness of your
order was able to take shelter from the frost. You
must admit that between the sunny hermitage of
St. Damian and the gloom of your Angevin convent
the difference is great. There will be no fire there,
only a uniform grey shadow where humility is powerless.
What sort of humility is yours, Massimilla? I
think your desire for slavery is a very lofty one.”</p>

<p>She sat in silence, discouraged and gasping; and
she was so sweet and so miserable in her distress, that
I should like to have taken her on my knees.</p>

<p>“When you appeared to me the first day on the
steps, you reminded me directly of an ermine. Well,
somehow it seems as if in our imagination the whiteness
of ermine could not be separated from the pride
of the purple, so much accustomed are we to see
them together on royal mantles. Perhaps you wear
your mantle inside out, Massimilla, so that the purple
is invisible underneath. That is often the way with
a Montaga.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she answered vaguely. “It seems
as if everything you say must be true.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>It was as if she was making a confession&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will be what you wish me to be.”</p>

<p>“If I were your husband, Massimilla,” I added, to
soothe her little trembling soul, “I would give you a
house where the light should enter through slabs of
honey-coloured alabaster, or through windows painted
with legends; you should be served by ladies-in-waiting
and mutes shod with felt and dressed in quiet
colours, who would pass by you like great night-moths;
and some of the rooms should have crystal walls
looking over immense pools of water, hidden from
sight by curtains which your hand could easily draw
back whenever you felt the desire of a dream voyage
with open eyes over an ocean valley full of strange
rich forms of life; and round the house I would make
you a garden of trees which should strew flowers and
weep spices, and it should be peopled with gentle,
graceful animals, such as gazelles, doves, swans, peacocks.
And there in harmony with everything around
you, you should live for me alone. And every day,
after satisfying my desire of rulership over men by
some worthy act, I would come and breathe the
rarefied air of your silent love, I would come and
live by your side the pure life of my thoughts. And
sometimes I would inspire you with a vehement fever;
and sometimes I would make you weep inexplicable
tears; and sometimes I would make you die and
come to life again, so that I might appear more than
man in your eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>Was she in the meantime preparing herself for
departure, or was she lingering, impatiently expecting
that which for her henceforth was not to be?</p>

<p>As I walked up the alley of old box-trees where
Violante had first appeared to me under the great
archway, she came to meet me almost at the same
place, smiling a new smile.</p>

<p>“You look like an angel bringing good tidings
to-day,” I said. “The whole spirit of April is in you.”</p>

<p>She gave me her hand, which I took and held for a
moment in my own.</p>

<p>“What have you got to tell me?” I asked, for I
read in her eyes the presence of something new which
transfigured her.</p>

<p>My look embarrassed her; and once more her
colour rose, seeming almost violent in contrast to her
pallor.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she said.</p>

<p>“And yet,” I said, “your whole figure seems to
express annunciation. You shall tell me about it
without speaking, if you will allow me to walk beside
you for a little. I have never felt your harmony so
perfect, Massimilla, as just now.”</p>

<p>She certainly thought I was speaking to her of
love, she was so confused. And there shone from
her whole figure such a bright spirit of gentleness,
that I thought once more of those gentle ladies
assembled in the imagination of young Dante; from
whose lips from time to time fell words mingled with
sighs, as falls “water mingled with beautiful snow.”
And because I loved her in a superhuman way, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
of those ancient words came back to my memory:
“To what purpose dost thou love thus? Tell us, for
certain it is that the purpose of such love must be
quite new.”</p>

<p>We had left the central alley, and were now penetrating
into the grassy labyrinth. The bird guests
of the cloister were singing, bright insects buzzed
around; but my ear was listening to the rustle of the
hem of her skirt as it bent down the heads of the
long grass. At last Massimilla confessed, in a shy
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>“My departure has been put off.”</p>

<p>She added, as if to justify herself&mdash;</p>

<p>“So I shall be able to keep the last Easter with my
own people.”</p>

<p>But to me it seemed as if she had suddenly fallen
into my arms, and as if her cheek were clinging to
my breast so closely that to unclasp her from me
would be to hurt her.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“That is good news!”</p>

<p>And I said nothing else, for my emotion at the
contact with that throbbing life was so fierce that it
prevented any pitiful feigning. It was clear that she
expected words of love and joy from me; that I
should take her hand and ask: “Will you renounce
your vows for ever and be mine entirely?” That
was what she expected. And feeling her anguish so
close to me, feeling her longing to surrender herself
and be happy fanning my face almost like a flame, a
shudder ran through me, such as a man would feel if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
he were suddenly shown a great wound where the
most hidden intricacies of the living flesh were laid
bare. There was something of that horror in my
suffering. Up to that time I had played with the
gentle soul, treating it like soft locks of hair through
which it was sweet to run one’s fingers with the
knowledge that next day it would be cut off. And
now this soul was clinging to mine with its whole
anguish.</p>

<p>“I could make thee a creature of joy!” It was
like a promise, it was almost passion. Both promise
and passion too had rung in my last words; and
indeed at that very hour my attentive ear had been
able at times, as I bent over that sweet soul, to discern
some trace of the hidden vein whence the
beautiful sudden laughter had sprung one day. Ah,
why was I doomed to deceive such sorrowful hope,
and to renounce crowning my powers with that
silent adoration?</p>

<p>We were alone, and it was a strange solitude in
which I could almost feel the emptiness of the
airy space that the two other figures would have
occupied had they been beside us. And the restlessness
which their absence produced in my spirit
was as painful as the stress of waiting.</p>

<p>“Where were Anatolia and Violante, what were
they doing just then? Were they also in the
garden?” I saw them appearing at the turn of every
path, and imagined the expression of their first look
as they met us. And I thought of the strangeness of
the behaviour of both during the past few days, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
sought to discover its true meaning. Anatolia rose
before me with her kind, heroic, martyr’s smile,
resigned to pour out her heart’s strength to the
last drop that she might soothe incurable ills; she
rose before me with those pure eyes of hers, which at
times flashed invitingly like the waters of legendary
lakes when a sudden glitter reveals the existence of
hidden treasures. Wrapped in her apathy and disdain,
Violante rose before me in an enigmatic attitude
which might almost be hostile, and inspired me with
a kind of discomfort such as gloomy presentiments
are wont to produce; for behind her in my imagination
was her fatal rock, and the mystery of her distant
apartments clouded with deadly perfumes.</p>

<p>I should like to have asked her who was at my
side: “Is there any change in your beloved sisters’
voices when they speak to you or to each other? Is
there anything that hurts you sometimes in their
voices and their looks? And at times when you are
sitting side by side breathing the same air, does a
heavy silence fall upon you, like the silence before a
storm? And then do you feel all your tenderness
dry up, and a bitterness like venom rise within you?
And, tell me, do your sisters weep apart? Or does it
sometimes happen that you all weep together?”</p>

<p>Thus would I fain have questioned the silent
maiden, and with her have suffered the pain of
loving.</p>

<p>I looked at her. She was suffering and rejoicing.
“You always carry a book,” I said, for the sake of
breaking the charm, “like a sibyl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>She showed me the volume.</p>

<p>“It is the book I had that first day,” she said, with
the indefinable tone in her voice which betrays the
moisture of tears.</p>

<p>“And the blade of grass?”</p>

<p>“Is burnt up.”</p>

<p>“Put in a red rose instead.”</p>

<p>But there was such humble grace in her emotion,
she let her inward ardour appear so ingenuously, that
I could not leave her, nor resist the sweetness of
seeing her melt little by little.</p>

<p>“Let us sit down,” I said. “Let us read a few
pages together. Do you like this place?”</p>

<p>It was a little mound in the meadow, starred with
anemones, and peaceful; some pointed yew-trees
near gave it something of the look of a cemetery.
In the centre, a caryatid, bent double so that
her breast touched her knees, supported the marble
slab of a sundial. And there, like seats at a table,
were two benches for a couple of lovers who might
wish as they looked on the shadow of the dial
to experience the melancholy delight of perishing
slowly and harmoniously together. Carved in the
marble under the figures of the hours, this legend
was still traceable&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1 center"><small>ME LUMEN, VOS UMBRA REGIT.</small></p>

<p class="p1">“Let us sit down here,” I said. “It is a delicious
place to enjoy the April sunshine and feel life flowing
on.”</p>

<p>A green lizard lying on the slab looked at us out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
of its small glittering eyes quite fearlessly like a
familiar spirit. When we sat down, it disappeared.
Then I laid my hand on the marble, which was very
hot.</p>

<p>“It is almost burning. Feel!”</p>

<p>Massimilla laid both her hands on it, white upon
white, and kept them there. The point of the
shadow reached the tip of her ring-finger, and the
number of the hour was covered by her palm.</p>

<p>“See how the hand points to you as the hour of
beatitude,” I said, for I profoundly enjoyed the harmonious
grace of her action, and I loved her thus.</p>

<p>She half closed her eyes, and once more her little
soul trembled on her eyelashes like a tear, and I
could have drunk it by merely bending forward.</p>

<p>“The saint,” I added, touching the book, “has a
divine verse for you in the waves of her prose, a verse
supremely sweet, sweeter than those which rose in
Dante’s mind before his exile. 'Stava quasi beata
dolorosa!’”</p>

<p>She felt surrounded by light and love, as perhaps
she may have felt before in her secret dreams; and
she drank from my words and my presence, and
from her own illusions and the fresh springtime, an
intoxication of which the memory would perhaps fill
her whole life. She did not speak, she sat motionless
in the attitude I had praised; but I understood the
ineffable things spoken by the eloquent blood in the
veins of her beautiful bare hands.</p>

<p>“Let me love her as long as she is of this world!” I
repeated to her sisters, while their sad eyes seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
gaze at me through the branches of the yew-trees.
“Let me gather these anemones and strew them on
the hair which is so soon to be shaven!”</p>

<p>She sat there almost beatified, and her unconsciousness
touched me, for I loved her, and was
saying to her: “I love thee, but on condition that to-morrow
thou diest. I give thee this flame that thou
mayest carry it with thee into thy grave. Such is
the necessity which compels us.”</p>

<p>She sat up and pressed her hands over her face,
and murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>“This sun is stupefying.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to go?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, with a faint smile. “According
to your advice, I ought to bathe myself in sunshine.
Let us stay here a little longer. You said you
wanted to read a few pages.”</p>

<p>She seemed as exhausted as if she had just come
out of a swoon.</p>

<p>“Read, there!” she begged, pushing the book
towards me.</p>

<p>I took it, opened it, and turned over the leaves
here and there, running my eyes over a few lines.
The flying shadow of a swallow passed over the
pages, and we heard the rustle of wings close by.</p>

<p>“How astonished I was,” she added, “when you
repeated St. Catherine’s exhortation to me that day!
I was still full of her spirit, and you were magician
enough to speak to me of her.”</p>

<p>There was such perfect confidence and abandonment
in her voice, that she could not have signified to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
me more plainly: “Here am I, I am thine; I belong
entirely to thee as no other living creature can, as no
inanimate thing can belong to thee. I am thy slave
and thy chattel.”</p>

<p>She really seemed to possess a supernatural quality,
to abolish in herself that law in love which denies
to man the privilege of being the giver and the perpetual
and perfect possession of the other. She
really seemed in the full sunlight to be transfigured
by my imagination into some crystal fluid, to become
a liquid essence for me to absorb, and bathe myself
in like a perfume.</p>

<p>“I think,” I said, “that sometimes when you read
this book you must feel your soul evaporate like a
drop of water on burning iron. Do you not? 'Fire
and abyss of charity dissolve for ever the cloud of
my body!’ cries the Saint. And you have marked
these words in the margin. You have a continual
aspiration to fade away.”</p>

<p>Her pale face smiled at me in the sunshine, looking
almost transparent against the whiteness of the
marble.</p>

<p>“Here is another place marked: 'Soul intoxicated,
tormented, and burning with love.’ And here is
another: 'Be thou a tree of love, grafted into the
tree of life.’ What eloquence of passion the virgin
has! She fascinates all the silent, because she speaks
and cries aloud for them. But that which makes the
book precious to whoever loves life is the abundance
of life-blood flowing through it, for ever boiling and
flaming like a sacrificial altar on the day of great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
sacrifices. This Dominican nun seems to have had
a crimson view of the world. She sees everything
through a veil of burning blood. 'The memory is
filled with blood,’ she says. 'I shall find the blood
and the living <em>creatures</em>, and I shall drink their love
and affection in blood.’ A kind of ruddy madness
assails her at times. 'Drown yourselves in blood,’
she cries; 'bathe yourselves in blood, intoxicate
yourselves in blood, clothe yourselves in blood, mourn
for yourselves in blood, rejoice in blood, grow and
strengthen yourselves in blood!’ She knows the
full value of that sweet and terrible liquid, for she
sees it not only in the chalice, but bursting from the
veins of mankind, she who has been caught in the
whirlwind of life, who has worn her veil in the midst
of the fierce hatred and violent passions which have
made her century beautiful. Here is that marvellous
letter of hers to Brother Raimondo of Capua. Have
you ever been able to read it without trembling to
your very marrow? 'And his head lay on my
breast. Then I felt a great joy within me, and the
odour of his blood rose up.’ What I perceive here
is not only the eucharistic ecstasy, but also real
voluptuousness. I can almost see the young woman’s
delicate nostrils tremble and dilate. Hers too is
that sentence I admire so much: 'Arming oneself
with one’s own sensuality.’ Her senses must have
been very acute, for her whole writings glow with
lively images, strong in colour and movement, and
almost Dantesque in their vigour and audacity. Ah,
sweet sister, she is not the guide to lead you peacefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
to the door of the cloister! Her Dominican
robe is full not only of the odour of blood, but of all
the odours of the proud life through which she
moved unconquered. A vast multitude clothed in
sackcloth and in purple, in iron and in gold, have swept
her away like a whirlwind, with 'the fire of anger and
hatred,’ which burns just as fiercely as the fire of
love. Friars, nuns, hermits, light women, soldiers
of fortune, princes, cardinals, queens, popes, all the
different temperaments of a hard and magnificent
century she deals with by her indefatigable will.
She is powerful in contemplation and in action. She
calls Alberico of Balbiano her 'beloved brother,’
and the knights of the company of St. George her
'beloved sons.’ And she dares to write to Queen
Joanna of Naples: 'Alas, one must weep over you
as over one dead!’ And to Gregory <span class="allsmcap">XI.</span>: 'Be a
brave man and not a coward.’ And to the King of
France she says: 'I will.’ That is why I admire
her, Massimilla, and also because she possesses a
Garden, a House, and a Cell of self-knowledge;
and because this saying is hers: 'To eat and taste
souls’; and lastly, because it was she who wrote,
before da Vinci: 'The intellect nourishes the affections.
Who knows most, loves most; and loving
most, enjoys most.’ Lofty words, which are the
rule of all beautiful inward life.”</p>

<p>As I was speaking, I could follow in Massimilla’s
wide open, steady eyes the slow rhythm of a wave
which seemed to have some mysterious musical relation
with the sound of my voice; and this sensation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
was so new and strange to me, that I prolonged what
I was saying for fear of interrupting it.</p>

<p>Indeed, hardly had I ceased speaking, when she
bowed her head, and in silence let two rivers of tears
flow from her limpid eyes.</p>

<p>I did not ask her why she wept; but I took her
hands, which were like soft leaves burning with the
midday heat. And under that glowing April sky,
beside that dazzling marble on which the shadow
of the hand of the dial seemed to have lain motionless
for an indefinite time, amidst those funereal yews and
wreaths of anemones, I tasted a few moments of unspeakable
exultation. I <em>saw</em> a spirit, not my own,
suddenly reach that part of life&mdash;and for a few seconds
rest there&mdash;beyond which, according to Dante’s words,
none can pass with intent to return.</p>

<p>And it seemed to me that afterwards the rest of
love and life could not have any value for that
spirit.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>
</div>

<p>After this the blessed maiden seemed to resume
the aspect of a figure of Prayer, in which she had
appeared to me the first day, as she sat between her
two brothers. Lifting her veil to look into the
depth of her eyes, I had seen a swift miracle worked
under my gaze. The memory of it dazzled me still,
but the veil had fallen again, and for ever.</p>

<p>Once more she seemed to me like one who has “departed from this
present age.”</p>

<p>So much so, that when Oddo, one day, told me the
pitiful story of her engagement broken off by death,
I listened as one listens to a legend of ancient times,
and felt then how strong and genuine my intellectual
detachment was.</p>

<p>She had been loved and asked in marriage by
Simonetto Belprato two years before; and, like
Iphanea, had lost her betrothed almost on the eve of
the wedding.</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="p1">
“Già vicino alle sue nozze, beata<br />
Le ghirlande apprestava; e le fu spento.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">Oddo recalled to my mind the faint memory of
Simonetto, and described to me the gentle youthful
figure of the student, last heir of a noble family of
Trigento, living a retired life with his widowed
mother in the country, where he studied botany and
died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“Poor Simonetto!” said Oddo with brotherly regret,
“I can see him still in his botanising dress, his tin
case slung over one shoulder, his iron-shod stick and
his green morocco pocket-book. He used to spend
almost his whole time botanising, or preparing and
drying the plants he had collected. His house
was full of herbariums, and he might well stamp his
floreated coat-of-arms as an emblem on their covers.
You know what the Belprato arms are?&mdash;a shield
divided by a bar of gold, the upper half red with a
silver lily, the lower green, strewn with red flowers
and golden leaves. Is it not a strange coincidence,
Claudio? That the last of the Belprato should be a
botanist! I used to prophesy to Massimilla in fun:
'You will end between two leaves of grey paper.’
They were betrothed to each other in the garden
over his collecting, and they seemed made for each
other. We were pleased too, for Massimilla would
have entered a good family, and would not have
lived very far away from us. (The Belprato, as you
know, are of very ancient nobility, though during the
last few centuries they have decayed. They came
over from Spain to Naples with Alphonso of
Aragon.) Everything was ready for the wedding.
I remember so well the day that the wedding-dress,
the kind gift of our aunt Sabrano, arrived from
Naples with its wreath of orange blossom. Massimilla
tried it on; it was delicious. Antonello and
I wanted Anatolia and Violante to try it on for
luck; poor dear creatures! The wreath, I remember,
got twisted among Violante’s hair in such a strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
way that it was impossible to take it off without
tearing out a few hairs clinging to the flowers.
One of the servants muttered that it was a bad
omen. She was right. Simonetto was, indeed, to
fall a victim to his mania. It was autumn, and he
used often to go to Linturno to gather the water
plants on the stagnant river. There it was that
he contracted the germs of the poisonous fever
which carried him off in two days. We had a
funeral instead of a wedding. Our usual bad
fortune!”</p>

<p>We were in Antonello’s rooms; the blinds were
drawn, and the place was half dark, for outside the
day was clouding over. I could not see the sky out
of the windows, yet I could feel the sensation of the
gentle, rather enervating, heat outside, and I felt sure
that out of doors a few drops of rain had begun to
fall, some of those warm tears that are so soft when
they fall on face or hands. Antonello was lying
motionless on his bed without speaking. Every now
and then a swallow could be heard chattering.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” I asked Oddo, “that is why Massimilla
is going into the convent?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I don’t think so,” he replied.
“It is a long time ago now. But certainly life in this
house must be more wearisome for her than for the
others. I always think she must feel as dried up
and extinguished as the plants in the herbariums
Simonetto left her in his will. Ah, that wedding-dress
laid by in a cupboard like a relic! Think of
it! That white robe which by this time must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
full of the odour of dried plants! Think of it! Do
you think that death can have any museum in the
world sadder than that of which Massimilla is the
guardian? Sometimes I am unjust; sometimes I
cannot conceal the bitterness that rises in my heart
when I think that Massimilla is going away, is going
to forsake us. I feel as if her departure would bring
about the final dissolution. I feel as though a whirlwind
would come to scatter and destroy us all, like a
heap of useless rags. And she in the meantime is
seeking to save herself. But I am unjust. She is
perhaps the most unhappy of all us here. What I
used to say to her in jest has come true. She believes
herself to have become like the leaves and flowers
in a herbarium. To revive herself, to call up the
illusion of living, she forces herself into contact with
living things. Have you not seen her plunge her
hands in the grass and hold them there, so as to feel
the caterpillars and insects among it run over her
skin? Don’t you know the hours and hours she
spends in the garden looking for animals, and making
friends with them? In all this she is, as you said, a
pattern of Franciscan perfection. But what would
you say if you knew that it is really nothing but an
anxious desire to realise life? I understand it; I
am perhaps the only one who understands....”</p>

<p>He said the last words in a low voice, almost as if
he were talking to himself; then he paused, possibly
to contemplate within himself the creation of his disturbed
fancy. Was it only the dream of a sick man?
Or did the living Massimilla really correspond to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
forsaken guardian of dead plants? I did not linger
over such doubts; for I wished to absorb all the
poetry which the strange fancies diffused through
the shadow of the room, where now the faint patter
of the rain reached us, and awakened in my nostrils
the desire to inspire the savour of the moist earth.
I rose and opened the nearest window a little; the
smell of the earth floated in.</p>

<p>“During the first few months after Simonetto’s
death,” Oddo resumed, “she took great care of the
herbariums. She used to pass long hours in the
room where they were kept, examining the plants
and reading the labels. And I used often to keep
her company, for I was very sorry for her. One
day, I remember, I came upon her opening the cupboard
in the same room where her wedding-dress
was kept. Another day, I remember, in the springtime
I saw her quite agitated because one of the
narcissus bulbs had flowered.... It was strange,
wasn’t it, Claudio? I saw that bulb come up again
last spring. And this year? I have not asked
Massimilla.... Shall we go and see?”</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, seized with a feverish impatience,
and took a few steps towards the door.
But Antonello, who was still lying on his pillows,
rose also with the same look&mdash;how well I remembered
it!&mdash;as had passed over his face when he warned us
of the coming of the gloomy sedan chair; and raising
a finger to his lips to bid us keep silence, he leant
against the wall which formed a side of the loggia
and listened. Nothing was to be heard in the silence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
save the gentle monotonous patter of the soft spring
shower in the enclosed garden.</p>

<p>“Don’t go out!” whispered Antonello.</p>

<p>We did not ask why, for the cause of his terror
was evident in his thin contracted face. And as the
sound of steps and voices reached us, Oddo went up
to the door, opened it a little, and peeped out. I
went up to it too, and, standing at his shoulder, I
could see through the chink Anatolia leading her
mother along the covered loggia, with her arm in
hers, and one of the grey woman servants following.
Princess Aldoina walked with difficulty, leaning her
whole weight upon her daughter. She was strangely
dressed in a grand gown with a long train, and was
decked out with false jewellery. She looked pale
and enormous, with her head raised and a little
thrown back, her eyes half closed, and an indescribable
smile playing on her lips, as if the sound of the
rain on the pavement of the quadrangle had been a
murmur of homage from courtiers, through whose
ranks she was passing, a queen on the way to her
throne. And the full light of sorrowful pity shone
in the daughter’s face as she leant over the mad
woman.</p>

<p>As the apparition vanished, our souls for a few
moments were full of affectionate anguish. And
while the echo of the sad footfalls was still audible,
the maiden’s figure in that attitude of pity and
sorrow which had revealed her to me in her true
and supreme light rose before me with extraordinary
clearness. And my inmost soul felt an almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
religious awe, such as one feels in presence of a holy
mystery; for none of the previous actions wrought
before my eyes by this pure spirit of consolation
seemed equal in value and significance to this action
performed by her, all unconscious of my hidden
gaze. She rose suddenly to a sublime height
in my soul; she shone with the whole glory of her
moral beauty, supported by the whole force of her
heroic will. Contemplated thus, apart from any
affinity to myself, in the secret of her own life to
which I was a stranger, in the absolute sincerity of
her feeling, she seemed to me a being of an ideal
race; and my spirit linked her with those noble
creatures immortalised by the poets, divine victims
of a voluntary sacrifice. Antigone leading her blind
father by the hand, or prostrating herself to strew
dust over her brother’s corpse, was not more tender
or stronger than she, had not a purer brow nor a
larger heart. In the midst of that sort of languid
monotony, in that enervating shadow where a sick
man was sounding the depth of his own ills, and a
restless voice was calling up a vision of empty misery
from withered flowers, the <em>consoler</em> appeared suddenly
bringing refreshment to my soul; and as a sudden
light piercing a dark wall makes the motionless
sword glitter among the hanging trophies, so did
she strike a great flash out of my dormant will.
There was strength in her to produce miraculous
fruit. Her substance might have nourished a superhuman
germ. She was indeed the “nourisher,” but
such a one as the virgin Antigone appeared to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
blind Œdipus when he was exiled and erring. Did
not she alone, like the ancient heroine, keep alive in
the depths of her great heart the genial flame which
had been extinguished on the hearth of her failing
race? Was not she alone the life of the gloomy
house? Massimilla in her barren garden, Violante in
her cloud of perfumes, paled before their sister as she
walked along the path of self-sacrifice with so firm a
step, so sweet a smile.</p>

<p>And I thought of Him who was to come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We were sitting, Prince Luzio and I, near an open
balcony about the hour in the afternoon when the
fierce heat of that dying May was beginning to be
tempered, and the pilgrim clouds were throwing a
few deep blue shadows over the burning valley. The
anniversary of King Ferdinand’s death was approaching,
so the loyal Prince, who always celebrated it
with mourning, was relating to me all the sorrows
and horrors of the long agony of the King; and
against a background of perfumes rising from the
walled garden, the gloomy phantoms awakened by
the aged voice followed each other in long succession.
The silent journey over the heights of Ariano, and
through the valley of Bovino amid snowstorms; the
fatal omens which occurred at every step; the first
signs of illness appearing one frosty evening when
the King, numb with cold, was toiling over the ice
which covered the slope; his anxious desire to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
continue on his road without any delays, as if an
inexorable destiny were urging him on; the fearful
pallor which suddenly came over him in presence of
the crowd, amongst honours which he felt to be the
last he would receive; the cries which the attack
drew from him, but which were drowned by the
clamour of the wedding feast; the distress of the
doctors who assembled round his bed to consult
under the hostile and suspicious eyes of the Queen; his
burst of tears when the Duchess of Calabria, a fresh,
youthful figure, entered the infected room where he
lay aged and almost stupefied by suffering; then his
tragic good-bye to his own statue as the nurses were
carrying him into another room; then the embarcation
on board ship, a ceremony as sad as a funeral,
and his mournful words as the litter was carried down
under the hatchways, which had been enlarged by
the strokes of hatchets; then the arrival at Caserta,
the rapid change for the worse, the putrid decay of
his body on the great bed surrounded by sacred
images, miraculous relics, crucifixes, lamps, and
tapers; at the last the pomp of the Viaticum, the
King sitting up among the pillows quite unrecognisable,
to the terror of those present; the last words,
the Christian serenity of his death, the dispute
between the Queen and the doctors about the embalming
of the body, the band of soldiers round the
bier told off to cleanse incessantly the innumerable
terrible sores;&mdash;all these sorrows and all these horrors
passed through his recollection. And I listened and
thought of the Duke of Calabria sobbing in a corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
like a girl. “Ah, what grand and beautiful ambitions
the odours of death might have nourished in his
youthful soul through those terrible spring weeks!
In what proud intoxicating meditations my soul
would have been wrapped beneath the shadow of
the great trees, and how petty the eager agitation
caused by the stirring of the sap in their powerful
trunks would have seemed in comparison with mine!”</p>

<p>Prince Luzio told me how one day the Duke of
Calabria, trembling and aghast, suddenly entered his
sick father’s room to tell him of the expulsion of the
Grand Duke of Tuscany, and with what violent words
the King had condemned his relation’s timidity.</p>

<p>“Ah, if Ferdinand had not died!” exclaimed the
old man, with an almost threatening gesture. “A few
hours before he expired he said: 'The crown of Italy
has been offered me....’ Don’t you think, Claudio,
that a Bourbon might have been wearing it now?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” I replied, very respectfully. “And if
it were so, the highest honours in the kingdom
ought to be bestowed upon the Prince of Castromitrano.
Let me tell you how much I admire your
dignity and faith! You are one of the very few
among our equals who have maintained the sentiment
of the virtue of race intact and intense. Rather
than renounce your privileges and take up an attitude
unsuited to your legitimate pride, rather than appear
only a survival of yourself, you retired from the world,
but not until you had startled it with the supreme
splendour of your magnificence; and you have sought
in solitude to await the fortune which Fate may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
reserving for your house. Misfortune has treated
you as a great man, for sorrow also has its privileges,
and yours have been fully acknowledged.”</p>

<p>The Prince’s fatherly face had become grave and
attentive. The veneration I felt in my soul for his
beautiful white head was far deeper than that expressed
in my words; and added to it was a tender
feeling so pure that only a feminine presence could
have inspired it. The fact was that I felt the
presence of Anatolia’s spirit. She had appeared on
the threshold of the door at the end of the room,
had passed silently along the wall, and had sat down
in a shadowy corner, looking white, mysterious, and
propitious as a family genius.</p>

<p>“Far away from the world though you are,” I added,
“and wrapped in such a thick cloud of sadness, you
have yet been able to nourish to this day hope of the
resurrection of that which is dead; and the prophecy
of your faith still rings in my ears. No doubt that
which is dead shall rise again, but it shall be changed.
If you were to turn your eyes for a single moment
upon the spectacle which the world presents to-day,
you would feel your dream fall from your soul like
a dry leaf, and you would see that the recovery of
his little state, and even the acquisition of Italy,
would be useless to Francis of Bourbon. Whether a
Bourbon or a Sabaudo be on the throne, the King is
equally absent; for that man cannot be called a king
who has submitted to the will of the many in accepting
a prescribed and narrow office, and who then
humbles himself to fill it with all the diligence and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
modesty of a public clerk who is perpetually spurred
on by the fear of being dismissed. Do I not speak
truly? Nor would Francis be able to reign in any
other way. Directly after his father’s death he
wrote out with his own hand an edict to re-establish
the results of the abolished constitution. And it
was Alessandro Nunziante who prevented its being
published. Just think of the lamentable proclamation
of the 8th December, dated from the guard-house
at Gaeta. Was that the language of a king,
and of a vanquished king?”</p>

<p>Prince Luzio had listened in silence, with knitted
brows, and now he said, not without a shade of
severity&mdash;</p>

<p>“One can see that you have the blood of Gian
Paolo Cantelmo in your veins.”</p>

<p>“The blood of all my ancestors is in my veins.
Ah, dear father (let me call you by that name!), I
well know how painful it must be to you to renounce
an ideal of justice before which the flame of your
loyalty has burned for so many, many years; but I
must tell you that for us and our like there is no
salvation unless we substitute energetic purpose for
empty hopes. Allow me to speak to you plainly and
without circumlocution. It is useless to hope that
any heroic fire will suddenly arise from the stagnant
blood of Saint Louis. I have seen the exile quite
recently; he is full of placid resignation, given up to
good works and prayer; he remembers his short
reign as a far-away, painful dream. Your prophecy
would call up a mild, incredulous smile on his lips&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
is all. If his spirit sometimes flies towards the
bay, not Capodimonte but the height of Camaldoli is
its goal. He has grown used to a quiet, pious life;
the glitter of the crown no longer disturbs his nights.
Let us leave him to sleep peacefully!”</p>

<p>The head of the loyal prince had fallen on his
breast, and I saw the lines deepen on his bent brow
like furrows full of thoughts.</p>

<p>“It is not for him alone that fate is dark. The
twilight of kings is ashy, blinded of all glory. Look
even beyond the Latin countries. Under the shadow
of artificial thrones you will see false monarchs fulfilling
their public duties with the accuracy of automatons,
or giving their attention to the cultivation of
their childish manias and their petty vices. The most
powerful of all, the lord of the hugest multitudes,
consumes away alone in his dark misanthropy, his
herculean muscles corroded by the moth of suspicion.
He has not even the taste for quenching the petty
chemical formulas of his rebel subjects in some
magnificent massacre by the naked sword, such as
might water and fatten his barren lands. He has a
truly royal soul, however, which perhaps you may
have been able to study near at hand, for he is of
the race of Maria Sophia. Wittelsbach attracts me
by the immensity of his pride and his melancholy.
His efforts to make his life conformable to his ideal
are desperate in their violence. All human intercourse
makes him shudder with disgust and anger;
all pleasure seems nauseous to him unless it is what
he himself has planned. Exempt from the venom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
of love, hostile to all intruders, for years he has held
intercourse with no one, save the resplendent heroes
which a creator of beauty has given him as companions
in super-terrestrial regions. In the depths
of rivers of music he slakes his anguished thirst for
the divine, and then he ascends to his solitary haunts,
where, amidst the mystery of mountains and lakes,
his spirit creates the inviolable kingdom over which
alone he desires to reign. This profound feeling for
solitude, this power of breathing on the highest and
loneliest summits, this consciousness of being unique
and unapproachable in life, makes Louis of Bavaria
truly a king, but king of himself and of his dreams.
He is incapable of stamping his will upon the multitude,
and of bending it under the yoke of his idea;
he is incapable of reducing his inward power to
action. At the same moment he appears sublime
and childish. When his Bavarian troops were fighting
the Prussians, he was far away from the battlefield,
hidden in one of his lake islands, where he forgot
his shame under one of those ridiculous disguises
which he wears to favour his visionary illusions.
It would be better for him if, instead of placing a
screen between his majesty and his ministers, he
could attain to the marvellous nocturnal empire sung
by his poet! It seems incredible that he should not
have left the world before now, carried away by his
flights of fancy....”</p>

<p>The Prince’s head was still bent in such a solemn
attitude, that even in the heat of speaking my heart
smote me with the fear of having wounded him; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
a filial desire came over me to comfort him, to lift up
his grand white head, and to see the unwonted light
of joy in his eyes. Anatolia’s presence kindled a
sort of generous fire in my soul, and made me feel
a great desire to reveal what was noblest and
strongest within me. She sat motionless and silent
in the shadow like a statue, but her attention shone
on my soul like a flood of light.</p>

<p>“You see, my dear father,” I resumed, unable to
control the tremor throbbing in my voice&mdash;“you see
how old legitimate monarchies are everywhere declining,
and how the Multitude stands by ready to
swallow them down its miry throat. Truly they
deserve no other fate! And not monarchies alone,
but all great, and noble, and beautiful things, all the
sovereign ideals which once were the glory of struggling
and conquering Man, all are about to disappear
under the immense flood of corruption which is
rising and swaying onwards. I will not tell you
how far the shame has gone, for I should have
to use words which would offend your ear; and
afterwards it would seem as though the air had to
be purified with grains of incense. I came away
from the city choking with disgust, but now I think
almost with rejoicing of the general dissolution.
When everything shall have been profaned, when all
the Altars of Thought and Beauty shall have been
cast down, when all the vessels containing ideal
essences shall have been broken, when ordinary life
shall have reached such a pitch of degradation as
seems unsurpassable, when the last smoking torch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
shall have gone out in the great darkness, then the
Multitude will stop, suddenly seized by a panic far
exceeding any that has ever before shaken its miserable
soul; and, suddenly deprived of the frenzy which
blinded it, will feel itself astray in the desert strewn
with ruins, without any path or light to guide it.
Then will the law of the need of heroes descend
upon it; and it will pray for the iron rod by which
it must be disciplined anew. And I believe, dear
father, that these heroes, these new kings of the earth,
shall arise from our race, and that from this day all
our energies ought to be directed towards preparation
for their earlier or later advent. That is my faith.”</p>

<p>The Prince had lifted his head, and was looking at
me with intent and rather astonished eyes, as if I had
appeared to him in an unexpected light. But an
unusual vivacity animating his whole person told me
how much he had been touched by my eagerness.</p>

<p>“I have lived for several years in Rome,” I continued,
with greater confidence, “that third Rome
which was to have represented 'the unconquerable
love of the Latin race for the Latin soil,’ and whose
hills were to have shone with the marvellous light of
a new ideal. I have witnessed there the most shameful
violations and the most obscene connections which
ever defiled a sacred spot. And I can understand the
lofty symbolism hidden in the act of the Asiatic
conqueror, who cast five myriads of human heads
into the foundations of Samarkand, when he wished
to make it his capital. Don’t you think that the wise
tyrant meant to signify the necessity of severe pruning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
on the part of those who are about to institute a
really new order of things? It was necessary to
sacrifice and cast into the foundations of the third
Rome the men who were called liberators, and,
according to the funeral custom of the ancients, to
place at their feet, at their sides, and in the hands
which freed their country the objects which they knew
and loved best, and then to dig out and drag down the
heaviest granite boulders from the mountain tops to
close the deep sepulchre for all eternity. But never
were lives so tenacious and so pestiferous laid in the
earth! Quite lately, dear father, I heard the following
in Rome: 'The fleet of the Thousand only sailed
from Quarto to obtain state protection for the right
of barter!’ And yet amidst the clatter of traders I
caught the sound of that remote mysterious voice
which lingers in every stone, and murmurs in every
sea-shell; and the sublime view of the Campagna
consoled me for all my disgust. Ah, father, who can
ever despair of the fate of the world while Rome is
still under the heavens? When I think of her and
worship her, I only see her as she is figured on
Nerva’s medal&mdash;with the rudder in her hand. When
I think of her and worship her, I can only describe her
strength in the words of Dante: 'In every generation
of things, that is best which is most perfectly One.’
And her principle of unity, as of old, shall once more
be the concentrating, ordering, and preserving force
of everything in the world that is good and amenable
to order. The Dantesque similes of the soil and the
flames are well adapted to her, because one can conceive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
the former as making a single base, and the
latter as united in a single and identical apex. I
firmly believe that the greatest height of power in the
future will be that which shall have its base and its
apex in Rome; for I, a Latin, glory in having set at
the head of my faith the mystical truth expressed
by the poet: 'It is certain that Nature disposed
one place in the world to be suitable for universal
empire, and that that place is Rome.’ Now from what
mysterious union of races, what vast experience of
culture, what auspicious harmony of circumstances,
shall the new King of Rome arise?”</p>

<p>The fine fever which had warmed my thoughts to
intoxication in the Latian desert again kindled in my
veins; and the great phantoms created by the sacred
soil again took tumultuous possession of my spirit; and
all the hopes begotten by my violent pride in those
solitudes haunted by memories of the most bloody
of human tragedies, rose again and stirred vaguely,
giving me a feeling of excitement which I could
scarcely endure. The venerable old man’s appearance
assumed a graver solemnity, for at that moment
I looked upon him as the embodiment of all those
varied qualities which had expanded like flowers
along the stem of his ancient race under the warmth
of the light of glory, and had been manifested to the
world in many magnificent characters; and I was
about to justify my ambitious dream to this man who
was already declining towards the grave, treating
him as a judge to whom sorrow had given insight; I
was going to ask his good auspices as an omen, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
to propose to him as my equal the alliance which I
desired.</p>

<p>My anxiety was heightened by the presence of the
silent maiden in the shadow, for she appeared to me
in truth to be the one destined to become through
love “her who propagates and perpetuates the idealism
of a race favoured by Heaven.” I did not dare
to turn towards her, so sacred did the mystery of her
virginity seem to me at that moment; but I remembered
the vague idea of hidden treasures, which the
wonderful light that shone in flashes from her transparent
eyes had sometimes awakened in me; and
even without turning round I could feel a kind of
animated wealth throbbing in that strip of shadow, a
living form containing an inestimable prize, something
infinitely grand and mysterious, like the divine
treasures guarded under veils in the holy of holies of
temples.</p>

<p>“You, as well as I, are convinced,” I added, “that
every form of excellence of the human type is the
effect of an initial effort, which by one selection after
another reaches its highest intensity, and is manifested
in the race, modified by temporary circumstance.
It is not only our patrician pride which
vaunts the virtue of Race, but it is acknowledged
also by the most exact science. The highest examples
of human conscience can only appear at the summit
of a race which has sprung up in time out of the
continual accumulation of energies and work; of a
race in which during long periods of centuries the
fairest dreams, the most vigorous sentiments, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
noblest thoughts, the most lordly wills have been
born and nourished. Now, take the case of a race
of remote royal origin, which is springing up under
the Latin sun in a happy land furrowed with the
rivulets of a new poetry. Transplanted into Italy, it
flourishes with such vigour that in a short time no
other race can compare with it. 'Worthless is the
disciple who cannot outdo his master,’ da Vinci has
pronounced. And that race seems to have inscribed
its greatness on an even bolder motto: 'Worthless
is the son who cannot outdo his father.’ Through
united and uninterrupted energies it goes on from
one generation to another, raising itself up to the
higher manifestations of life. In times of blind
anger, when reason can trust to nothing but arms, it
seems already to understand 'that those men who
above all others possess strength of intellect are by
nature lords over others.’ And from the very beginning
its discipline is of an intellectual nature, and
seems to have been dictated by Dante; for it consists
in always reducing to action the whole available
power of intellect, first of all by laying down theories,
and then by working them out. In the most important
offices, as truly as on the bloodiest battle-fields
and at the most liberal banquets, this race
excels: equally admirable whether leading armies,
governing states, conducting embassies, protecting
artists and sages, erecting palaces or churches. It
mingles with Italian life in all its most varied forms;
it bathes itself in every fresh fountain of culture.
Living is to it the perpetual assertion and increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
of itself: living to it is ruling. The formidable
instinct of rulership is always driving it forward,
while clear and steady thought directs this lasting
impulse. And always&mdash;like those careful archers
whom Machiavelli cites as examples&mdash;always it aims
higher than the mark. Its deeds are so illustrious
that the greatest poets have sung their renown, and
the writers of history compare them to those of the
ancient generals, and quote them as the examples for
the future. Yet it seems that the strength of this race
has not yet been fully manifested, has not yet reached
the unsurpassable height: it seems that its accumulated
energies must, either to-morrow, or in the
course of a century, or at some indefinite time, expand
themselves in one supreme manifestation....”</p>

<p>“<em>Cave, adsum!</em>” interrupted the Prince, with a
grand smile. “Is not that the motto of the race you
are speaking of?”</p>

<p>“It might also bear the motto of the Montaga,” I
replied readily, “<em>Sub se omnia!</em>”</p>

<p>The Prince bowed with a gesture that served of
itself to show that my reply had not been a simple
courtesy, but was indeed due to the dignity of his
great name. I saw him again before me with the
figure I remembered in my boyhood: a fine example
of superior humanity, every action revealing his distinction,
his absolute separation from the multitude,
from common duties, and common virtues. It seemed
to me as if he had shaken the weight of sorrow
that was crushing him off his shoulders, and had
risen up in all his manly strength, his whole frame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
assuming that marvellous quality possessed by his
hands&mdash;those beautiful pure hands preserved unchanged
as if they had been embalmed&mdash;surviving
ministers of a liberality which can only be compared
to the ancient “who for small services loved to reward
greatly.”</p>

<p>The last hour of daylight was fading away, and
from the burning sky the annunciation of summer came
down on the patrician garden, where amid the austere
odour of centenarian box-trees, the statues&mdash;pale and
yet watchful, like memories in a faithful soul&mdash;called
up by their gestures the phantoms of past grandeur.
But outside the cloister rose the immense crown of
rock fashioned by primeval fires, looking so harsh
and proud that it seemed worthy of supporting on
each peak a Prometheus Bound.</p>

<p>I had seen those same peaks on the first evening
of my arrival, flaming in the sky like rockets, shining
with incredible radiance, the highest of them standing
out like a tongue of flame against the background
of general shadow, and cleaving the sky like a cry of
hopeless passion. I was alone then in that remote
twilight, and the three mysterious princesses were
at hand in their walled garden, and my fate was still
apart from their fate. But now in the same conjunction
of circumstances the fate prophesied by that
first agitation of my feelings was about to be fulfilled:
I was about to utter solemn and irrevocable words.
Was I indeed quite freed from perplexity? Had I
at last chosen from those three blessed ones, whom I
had seen in fancy on that far away evening receiving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
my spring gift with open arms, had I at last chosen out
one for the necessary union? And was I about to
pronounce her name in her father’s presence? Fresh
uneasiness crept over me, and it seemed to me as if
Anatolia were no longer alone in the shadow, but as
if her sisters had come in silently and taken their
places beside her, and as if their eyes were fixed
anxiously upon me.</p>

<p>As I turned round I saw the white motionless
figure in the corner, and everything else vanished,
and all my vain restlessness was calmed.</p>

<p>She was the living symbol of security, the watcher
and the guardian. With her strength and her
patience, lit up by her own smile, she had turned
sorrow into an adamantine armour which made her
invincible. She was made to guard, nourish, and
defend to the death that which was committed to her
charge. And once again I saw her, in my dream,
watching, her pure brow radiant with prophecy over
the son of my blood and of my soul.</p>

<p>Then from the very roots of my being, where sleeps
the indestructible virtue of ancestors, there arose and
went forth towards the Elect the will to create that
one to whom all the ideal riches of my race and
my own conquests and the maternal perfections were
to be transmitted. And deeper than ever grew the
feeling of primary dependence which bound my
actual being to my remotest ancestors; and just as
the summit of the tree comprises in itself the whole
life of the branching trunk down to the deepest
roots, so I felt the life of the whole race living within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
me, that life which death could only destroy through
its bodily manifestations in the transitory forms taken
by succeeding generations. And the fulness and
vehemence of that life seemed to overthrow the
limits of my natural powers.</p>

<p>“Not long ago you recognised in me, not without
a shade of severity, the descendant of Gian Paolo
Cantelmo,” I said to the Prince, smiling. “I must
confess that in my house the examples of disobedience
and rebellion against kings are not rare.
But the red Lion justifies them; and you cannot be
unaware of the patent which the Cantelmi received
from Charles <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> of England. Being themselves of
ancient royal blood, they have never easily resigned
themselves to treating the king as other than their
equal. It appears, too, that they never fight any
other adversary with such zeal as they fight the
king. And while Gian Paolo disturbed the slumbers
of Ferdinand of Aragon, and humbled Alphonso,
James <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> and Menappo defeated Manfred at Benevento,
James <span class="allsmcap">VIII.</span> warred successfully against Ladislaus
side by side with Braccio di Montone and the
Sforza, while Antonio opposed René of Anjou.
There is a natural tendency in every Cantelmo to
form his own party, to separate himself, and to
define his own person and power very clearly. It
seems as if each of them founded his conception of
his own dignity upon the firm conviction 'that
being one is the root of being good, and that what
is good is such, because it is one.’ I joyfully
acknowledge in this, one of the essential characteristics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
of the ruler to come: of the Monarch, the
Despot. But there is another peculiarity which
strengthens my faith, and that is the great number
of rulerships which have fallen into the hands of the
Cantelmi on Latin soil. It may be said that at
different times and separately they have held the
government of all Italy. James <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> is Ambassador for
Peace to the Republic of Genoa, Vicar in Lombardy,
Captain-General in the March of Ancona, Viceroy of
the Abruzzi; James <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> is Vicar and Podestà of
Florence; Bonaventura <span class="allsmcap">VIII.</span>, Viceroy of Sicily; Rostaino
<span class="allsmcap">VII.</span>, Captain-General of the Serenissima, Senator
of Rome.... Everywhere they hold rule, and their
experience of different peoples teaches them to
'know well how men are to be gained or lost.’
Everywhere they fight and lose their lives in the act
of performing some prodigy of valour: the 'good
Cantelmo,’ immortalised in Tasso’s verse, stains the
walls of Jerusalem with his royal blood; James <span class="allsmcap">II.</span>
dies fighting for the Florentines against Castruccio
Castracane; Nicholas, first Duke of Sora, dies with
Constantine Paleologus in the defence of Constantinople;
Ascanio dies in the waters of Lepanto
beside the Archduke John of Austria; Bonaventura
<span class="allsmcap">VIII.</span> is deemed worthy by Charles <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> of the defence
of the whole empire; and it is of him the Emperor
says that he would choose him for his champion had
he to risk his crown in a joust. The great Andrea
is an extraordinary example of a life spent entirely
in ceaseless fighting from his earliest youth to his
latest breath.... He is indeed the most finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
type which my race has produced to this day.
Andrea is one of the finest heroes of will and
strength. We need not reckon up the number of
his exploits. In Italy, Germany, Flanders, France,
and Spain, innumerable are the cities and fortresses
acquired by him and added to the Catholic empire,
innumerable are the sieges he laid and sustained.
He is the Poliorcetus <em>par excellence</em>, a more fertile
master of stratagem than any other, at once eager
and prudent; 'for in him we discover,’ says one of
his biographers, 'the union of all those gifts and
qualities which in other captains may be noticed
separately.’ But what in my eyes raises him above
the heads of all others is the unheard-of severity of
the discipline he enforced on himself and his troops.
Certain traits of this rigour fill me with more
enthusiasm than the sight of the banners he took
from the enemy. Though the troops he commanded
are unpaid and badly armed, he manages to have
them as ready and obedient to his hand as his own
sword. No one ever understood better how to
impress his own personality on the conduct of others.
Eloquent and nervous in speech he yet always prefers
the direct force of example to the power of words.
He always moves at the head of his troops, on foot
when he leads the infantry; he always sleeps in his
clothes, eats and drinks nothing but what his soldiers
eat and drink, is always the first in assault, the last
in retreat; though covered with wounds, he refuses
to take off his armour; on the field of victory or
in the conquered city he never touches the booty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
And in the war in Flanders he wins such terrible
renown, that mothers use his name to frighten their
children into obedience. Could any man determine
his own likeness in clearer and more vigorous
outline? Was ever coined metal stamped with a
prouder effigy? In his time Andrea was surnamed
the new Epaminondas. Well, even in this indefatigable
warrior, the intellectual character of his
race comes out. He is not only learned in speech, a
distinguished mathematician, a master of military
architecture, a writer on the science of war, but also
a good connoisseur and splendid patron of the liberal
arts. Eritio Puteano, in dedicating a Latin work to
him, calls him <em>Armorum gloria, Litterarum tutela</em>.
Cornelius Schult of Antwerp, presenting him with a
book of fantastic designs, represents him as Eros
cultivating elegance in the midst of arms, <em>Heros
inter arma elegantias colens</em>. Andrea in this carries
on the family tradition, the origin of which shines in
the wreathed figure of Fanetta Cantelmo, Lady of
Romanino, who composed poetry 'with a certain
divine fury,’ among the laurels of Provence, in one of
the courts of love. And does not some of the wonderful
aptitude which raised Alessandro above the other
disciples of Da Vinci at Milan seem to have been
transmitted to him? He thinks out new methods of
fortification, constructs the celebrated fort on the
Meuse, named in honour of its inventor Fort Cantelmo,
makes strange weapons which seem almost
magical to his contemporaries.... Is there not something
Leonardesque in these inventions, something
which recalls Alessandro?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>I had uttered the name of him who lived in
continual communion with my spirit, and whom I
held to be the genius of the race, destined some day
to reappear higher up the surviving family tree in
some manifestation of sublime life. 'Oh thou, be
what thou oughtest to be.’ My task had been
developed along definite lines under his gaze and
his teaching; and now at the moment when I was
about to take a great resolve, he stood by my side.
I saw him alive before my eyes, as if his white
tyrannical hand were resting on the corner of the
table beside me, and as if the statuette of Pallas and
the pomegranate with its pointed leaf and flaming
flower were there too. 'Oh thou, be what thou
oughtest to be.’ And another youthful figure,
apparently his younger brother, clung to him as
closely as his shadow.</p>

<p>“Alessandro and Hercules! These were the two
purple flowers so early cut off, which Leonardo and
Ludovico gathered up and transmuted into imperishable
essences. Andrea Cantelmo when he
died had already displayed all the energies he
possessed, and death overtook him on the verge of
old age, covered with glory after that siege of
Balaguer, which was the greatest of his heroic enterprises.
But these two, facing life with their hands
full of all the seeds of hope, had every great possibility
open to them. Their youthful heads seemed
made to wear the royal crown, that ancient crown
which their fathers had already worn. In one of
them Da Vinci divined the future founder of a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
principality, the triumphant tyrant who was to lay
upon the multitude the yoke of that science and
beauty into which the great master had initiated his
favourite disciple. But fate interfered with the
fulfilment of his prophecy. Both of them threw
away their lives in the first burst of their ardour, for
they were devoured by too vehement enthusiasm.
Hercules perished in the sands of the Po, fighting
against the Sclavonians; Alessandro on the banks
of the Taro in the battle of Fornovo. Do you remember
the verses in which Ariosto celebrates the
beautiful son of Sigismond Cantelmo?</p>

<p class="p1">“His death was too cruel! He was made prisoner in
a rash inroad, and his head was cut off before his
father’s eyes on the ship’s deck, which was used as a
block. I can imagine the blood spurting from the
wound like a flame and scorching the side of the
galley. Indeed, I do not only imagine it, I see it.
What a wonderful and terrible storm of youthful
courage it must have been which provoked him to
set spurs to his horse and rush furiously against the
enemy’s entrenchments! Ah, dear father, I have
known those storms myself, and my horse knows
them, and so do the ruins of the Roman Campagna....</p>

<p>“No doubt at that moment Hercules felt worthy of
bestriding the winged horse born of the blood of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Medusa. <em>Cave, adsum!</em> Ariosto, as he sings his
praises, uses an expression which of itself lights
him up with glory, showing how the bold youth died
to maintain the resolution which every Cantelmo
makes&mdash;that of remaining at the post he has taken,
and has thought to be the best, even in the face of
the worst forms of death. He had a companion at
his side during the assault. When both had rushed
upon the enemy,</p>

<p class="p1 center">'Salvossi il Ferrufin, resto il Cantelmo.’</p>

<p class="p1">“He stayed, one against a thousand. And the divine
Ludovico places his beautiful bleeding figure at the
beginning of a song telling how Bradamante performed
prodigies with his golden lance. But the
death of Alessandro is like that of a demi-god. At
Fornovo in the hottest of the battle a hurricane
arises, and the Taro overflows its banks with terrible
violence. Alessandro suddenly disappears, like one
of those ancient Greek heroes, carried away from the
earth in a whirlwind, and supposed to be transported
to heaven. His body was never found on the field
or anywhere else. But he lives, lives on through the
ages, with life more intense than our own. Not
only his portrait has been transmitted to me by da
Vinci, but his life, his true life. Ah, dear father,
if you had once seen that picture, you would never
be able to forget it. It is impossible to forget.
Nothing in the world is of such value to me, and
no treasure was ever guarded with such passionate
jealousy. Who gave me strength to bear such long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
solitude and such hard discipline? Who poured
into my spirit in the midst of the harshest rigour
of discipline that kind of sober intoxication which
makes all effort seem light? Who but Alessandro?
He represents to me the mysteriously significant
power of style, inviolable in my own person by any
one, even by myself. All my life develops beneath
his steady gaze; and in truth, dear father, he who
can stand the searching trial of that fire is not
degenerate. 'Oh thou, be what thou oughtest to
be!’ that is his daily precept. But while he thus
urges me to keep my personality entire, he also
places before my eyes the vision of an existence
superior to my own in dignity and power. And I
am always thinking of Him who is to come.”</p>

<p>I stopped, for I felt my voice change, and I feared
that the blood filling my heart might of a sudden
overflow. And the old man’s soul was in such deep
communication with mine, that at that moment he
involuntarily stretched out both hands to me.</p>

<p>“Since a double will is necessary for the creation
of that one who is to outstrip his creators,” I
added in a low voice, bending towards him, “I could
aspire to no higher union than that which would
give me the right to call you father, as I am doing
now....”</p>

<p>And overcome by emotion, I sat leaning forward
with his trembling hands in mine, while his lips
touched my brow without a word being spoken.
But in the silence, between the throbbing of my
heart and her father’s quick breathing, I heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
light step of Anatolia gliding out of the room. Was
she going to weep by herself? Her form, which I
had seen motionless and white in the shadow, shone
on my inner heaven like a constellation of tears.
Was she going to weep alone? Perhaps she would
meet her sisters on the way.... This doubt
suddenly made me uneasy. My eyes fell on the
cameo that shone on the father’s hand.</p>

<p>And as the perfume of evening rose up from the
walled garden, a dim sentiment spread through my
soul, like a spell deepening round me with the slow
falling of the twilight.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>
</div>

<p>How in the meantime fared the heart of her who
was about to depart? In what manner was her
mystical life disposing itself round the memory of
that supreme hour marked by the hand on the
luminous dial?</p>


<p class="p1 center small1">“ME LUMEN, VOS UMBRA REGIT.”</p>

<p class="p1">Perhaps she may have returned more than once to
the little cemetery with the yew-trees and anemones,
and may perhaps again have laid her slender hands
on the dial to feel its heat, and she may have remembered
my exhortation: “Warm your hands in
the sun, bathe them in the sun, poor hands, for soon
you will carry them crossed on your breast or hidden
under the coarse brown woollen habit in the shadow....”
And more than once perhaps, with her palm
laid over the figures indicating the divine moment,
she may have waited, quivering in the great silence,
to see the shadow of the hand reach the extremity
of her ring-finger, as it did on that day of dreams;
and perhaps she may have wept that the miracle of
love had not been renewed.</p>

<p class="p1 center small1">“SINE SOLE SILEO.”</p>

<p class="p1">I connected the picture of the guardian of dried
plants sketched for me by Oddo with the picture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
that sad soul wandering round the sundial which had
pointed out the hour of blessedness for her in vain.
And I thought: “If only I had power to fashion for
thee a beautiful fate, as the artist fashions the obedient
wax, O thou who earnest towards me out of a barren
garden where a funereal vow had imprisoned thee
Massimilla, thus should I complete thy ideal figure
with death, with timely death I should complete thy
perfection; for no other hour awaits thee in which
thou canst hope to find any value, now that thou
hast once penetrated into that part of life, beyond
which none can go who intend to return. Guided
by that divine memory, I would have thee return to
the place where in dreams I gathered crown-like
anemones, to strew them on thy head; and there I
would have thee fall again into the harmonious
attitude that once I praised, close to the marble sundial.
And the moment the point of the shadow
reached the tip of thy ring-finger should be the
moment of thy death. Then beneath the stony gaze
of the crouching caryatid I should myself dig the
grave for thy frail remains; and I should lay thee
out as the gentle ladies laid out Beatrice in Dante’s
vision, and should spread their veil over thy head.
But I should not set a cross over thy grave, nor any
other pious symbol; rather I should call upon the
youngest of the sons of the Graces, a native of
Palestine, like thy celestial Spouse; I should call
upon Meleager of Gadara, the hyacinth-garlanded,
the sweet flute-player, the poet who sings the early
death of maidens; and he should carve an epitaph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
worthy of thy gentle grace. Oh Earth, universal
Mother, all hail to thee; be gentle to this maiden,
who weighs so lightly upon thee.”</p>

<p>Thus it pleased me to adorn the sentiment with
which she inspired me, and turn her sadness into
poetry.</p>

<p>“Has the narcissus bulb in the herbarium sprouted
for the third time?” I asked her suddenly one day,
as we were boating on the Saurgo near the dead city.</p>

<p>She was quite disturbed, and looked at me with
startled eyes.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>I smiled and repeated&mdash;</p>

<p>“But has it sprouted?”</p>

<p>“No, not again!” she replied, looking down.</p>

<p>We were alone in a little skiff, which I was paddling
myself with one oar. Violante, Anatolia, and Oddo
were in other boats rowed by the boatmen. The
river here was so wide and sluggish that it was
almost like a pond, and a dense flock of water-lilies
covered it. The great white flowers, shaped like
roses, floated among their shining leaves, diffusing a
moist fragrance, which seemed to have the property
of slaking thirst.</p>

<p>It was here that Simonetto’s botanising had come
to an end that fatal autumn. I imagined the figure
of the young botanist leaning over the water exploring
its slimy depths at the season when the water-lilies
are nearly over. His <em>hortus siccus</em>, no doubt,
contained lifeless specimens of all that aquatic flora
which surrounded the ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>Massimilla’s eyes followed the movement of my
oar as from time to time it crushed a leaf or broke a
stalk, and I said softly&mdash;</p>

<p>“Are you thinking of Simonetto?”</p>

<p>She started.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” she asked me again, much
agitated, with flushing cheeks.</p>

<p>“I know from Oddo....”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she said, without concealing her regret at
this knowledge of mine, which seemed to wound her.
“Oddo told you....”</p>

<p>She relapsed into a silence which I felt to be a
very painful one for her. I stopped rowing for a
few seconds, and the light boat rested motionless
amidst the wide extent of white blossoms.</p>

<p>“Did you love him very much?” I asked the silent
maiden, with a gentleness that reminded her perhaps
of our earlier interviews.</p>

<p>“As I love Oddo, as I love Antonello,” she replied,
with a tremble in her voice, without raising her eyelids.</p>

<p>After a pause I asked her&mdash;</p>

<p>“Are you going into the convent to sacrifice yourself
to his memory?”</p>

<p>“No, not for that. It would be too late now....”</p>

<p>“Why, then?”</p>

<p>She did not answer. But I looked at her hands,
which she was clenching as if she wanted to wring
them, and I understood all the involuntary cruelty of
my useless question.</p>

<p>“Is it true that you have decided to go in a few
days?” I added almost timidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“It is true.”</p>

<p>Her lips trembled; they had turned white.</p>

<p>“Will Oddo and Anatolia go with you?”</p>

<p>She nodded her head in answer, and pressed her
lips together to force back a sob.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Massimilla, if I have hurt you,” I said
with deep emotion, for I felt a weight of sadness
suddenly fall on me.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, please!” she implored, in a voice I
scarcely recognised. “Don’t make me cry! What
would my sisters think? I should not be able to
hide my tears.... And I am choking.”</p>

<p>Oddo’s voice was heard calling to us from the
ruins. Anatolia and Violante had already set foot
in the dead city. One of the boatmen came towards
us with his skiff, thinking perhaps that our delay
was caused by my inexperience in guiding the boat
through the tangle of water-lilies.</p>

<p>“Ah, I shall always bear within me the regret of
having lost thee!” I said in silence to her who was
about to depart. “I should rather behold thee laid
out in the perfection of death than know thy soul to
be straitened in a life alien to that which my love
and my art had promised thee. And perhaps thou
wouldest have led me to explore some far-away
region of my inner world, which without thee will
remain neglected and uncultivated....”</p>

<p>The boat was gliding lightly over the snowy flock;
in its track the leaves and blossoms rippled apart,
and through the crystalline clearness of the water the
pale forest of stems was visible, pale and languid, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
if fed by the mud of Lethe. The ruins of Linturno
embraced by the water and the flowers looked, in
their secular, stony apathy, like a great collection of
broken skeletons. Even the eyeballs of a human
skull are not so lifelessly empty as were the hollows
of those worn-out stones, bleached white like bones
by the mists and the heat. And I imagined that I
was ferrying a dead maiden.</p>

<p>Everything after that bore the impress of my sadness
on that cloudless afternoon. For a long time
we wandered about the ruins searching out the traces
of vanished life.</p>

<p>They were uncertain traces, which gave rise to all
sorts of different conjectures. Was the theory true
of the band of youths crowned with garlands descending
to the parent river singing and dedicating
their unshorn, growing locks to him? Or was it
rather a white procession of catechumens like little
children, fed on milk and honey, who descended
there to receive baptism? A dim legend of martyrs
cast a sort of mournful sanctity over the pagan
remains. “<em>Martyris ossa jacent....</em>” we read on the
fragment of a sarcophagus; and here and there
among the few sculptured stones lying about we
found emblems and symbols of double meaning;
Jove’s eagle and Cybele’s lion subdued to the Evangelists;
the vines of Dionysius twisted to express
the parable of the Saviour; Diana’s stag representing
the thirsty soul. Now and then a snake darted
out from among the stones and roots, and vanished
quickly as an arrow. An invisible bird was making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
a strange imitation of the rattles which announce
the hours of silence on Good Friday.</p>

<p>“And where is your great Madonna?” asked
Anatolia, recalling my words of long ago. We
sought among the fallen masonry for a path to lead
us to the ruined basilica, which stood at the extreme
end of the island, on the branch of the Saurgo nearest
the rocks.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the water will prevent our getting there,”
I said, as I perceived the glittering reflections close
to the wall.</p>

<p>The river had indeed flooded part of the sacred
ruin, and a forest of water weeds was growing there
undisturbed. But we found a gap by which we were
able to enter the apse. Each of the three sisters as
she entered made the sign of the cross, amid a great
whirring of wings.</p>

<p>Inside all was cool and damp, and the palpitating
light took a greenish hue. The apse and a few pillars
of the central nave were left, and formed a kind of
cave, which the waters had invaded almost up to the
deserted altar steps; and a multitude of water-lilies,
larger and whiter even than those through which we
had rowed, clustered as if in adoration at the feet of
the great Madonna in mosaic, who occupied alone
the concave heaven of gold which formed the apse.
She did not hold the Infant in her arms, but
stood alone, wrapped in a mantle of leaden hue
like a shadow of mourning, and a deep mystery of
sorrow lay in her large, fixed eyes. High above the
curve of the arch the swallows had made a charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
crown of nests, following the order of the words
written round it&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1 center small1">“QUASI PLATANUS EXALTATA SUM JUXTA AQUAS.”</p>

<p class="p1">And then the three maidens knelt down together
and prayed.</p>

<p>“If we were to leave thee in this refuge with the
water-lilies and the swallows!” I thought, looking at
Massimilla, who was bending lower and lower as she
prayed. “Thou wouldest live here like a hermit
Naiad who has forsaken Artemis to worship the new
sorrowful divinity.” And I pictured her metamorphosis:
after completing her solitary rites amid the
choir of swallows, she would plunge into the water
and descend to the roots of the flowers....</p>

<p>But to my eyes nothing here surpassed the whiteness
of a neck burdened with a weight of hair thicker
than the marble clusters of grapes that decorated the
front of the altar. For the first time I saw Violante
on her knees, and the attitude was so unsuited to the
quality of her beauty that it pained me like a discord;
and I waited with strange restlessness for her to rise
from the place between the two symbolical peacocks,
who were spreading their feathers among the clusters
of grapes.</p>

<p>She rose before the others, with one of those
magnificent movements in which her beauty seemed
to surpass itself, as a steady light seems to wax
larger before it suddenly breaks into sparks. <em>Exaltata
juxta aquas!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>When we returned she came with me on the river,
sitting in the little prow opposite me while I stood
and paddled. I was overcome by uncontrollable
emotion as I remembered the hand beaded with
blood and the hill-slope covered with blossom. It
was the first time since that far-away hour that I
had found myself alone with Violante face to face.</p>

<p>“I am so thirsty,” she said, leaning over the water
with a movement which, while expressive of her
desire, seemed to identify her with the liquid voluptuous
element.</p>

<p>“Don’t drink that water!” I begged her, seeing
that she bared her hands.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Don’t drink it!”</p>

<p>Then she plunged in her bare hands, picked a
water-lily, and bent over it to breathe its fragrant
moisture. It seemed as if a vague shiver passed over
the flowery covering around us. The sun had sunk
behind the rocks, and an almost imperceptible rosy
reflection fell from the evening sky on the innumerable
white flowers.</p>

<p>“Look at the water-lilies!” I exclaimed, resting on
my oar. “Don’t you think they look marvellously
alive just now?”</p>

<p>She plunged in her hands again up to the wrists,
and held them in the water like rosy floating flowers;
and as her eyes wandered over the trembling multitude,
the smile on her lips was so divine that in my
soul I invested it with miraculous powers.</p>

<p>Truly she was worthy to work wonders, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
subdue the very soul of things to her beauty. I
dared not utter a word, so speaking was the silence
by her side. But as we bent over the water, the
same spell seemed to bind us to each other as had
united us that first day in the presence of the volcanic
rock. The hawks were not screaming over our heads,
but round us the swallows were twittering as they
flew by, and something like a ray of light flashed
from their white breasts as they passed.</p>

<p>“Well; aren’t we going on? Have you no
strength left?” she said, turning round with an
indefinable tone of derision in her voice, and reading
the very depths of my eyes. “Don’t you see
that the other boats are far ahead?”</p>

<p>I gazed at the little flotilla for a few moments with
knitted brows.</p>

<p>“Anatolia is calling us,” she added. “Make haste!”</p>

<p>The Saurgo seemed to grow broader in the twilight,
to vanish away into infinite distance, then to regain
the strength of its current, to give promise of carrying
us on into fairer lands. And that royal creature,
bending over the great soft, rosy stream in the
eagerness of her thirst, of her fierce desire for a
liquid suited to her voluptuous being, was full of
such mystery, of beauty, and poetry that my soul
went out to her in the most fervent act of worship.</p>

<p>“Look!” then said the enchantress, pointing to the
scene which she seemed to have called up with a
wave of her hand. “Look!”</p>

<p>All around us on the water, over which a slight
shiver was passing, the living calyxes were closing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
with a slow lip-like motion, hesitating a few moments,
withdrawing, sinking, disappearing under the leaves
one by one or in groups, as if some power of slumber
were calling them below. Wide spaces were left
deserted, but here and there in the midst of them
a single belated lily would display the utmost of her
grace in this delay. A vague melancholy hovered
over the water on each spot where one of the lingerers
disappeared. And then it seemed as if the dreams
of the submerged multitude rose up like a mist from
the great soft rosy stream.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it was on the summit of Corace that the unexpected
revelation took place which finally decided
our fate.</p>

<p>We had stopped at Scultro to visit the ancient
abbey, where the remains still exist of a sumptuous
mausoleum, the work of Maestro Gualtiero of Germany,
built as a memorial of herself and her three
sons by a lady of the Cantelmo family&mdash;that magnificent
<em>Domina Rita</em>, who as the wife of Giovanni
Antonio Caldora was mother of the great condottiere
Jacopo. And Anatolia and I had lingered behind
in the mouldy chapel to gaze at the recumbent figure
of the young hero, clad to the throat in heavy armour,
with only the curly head uncovered, reposing so
royally on the marble pillow.</p>

<p>Then after a long climb on foot up a steep narrow
path&mdash;for we had left the mules behind on the level&mdash;we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
had reached the northern brow of the extinct
crater, now transformed into the lake to which Secli
gives its name. At our feet we had, on the one
hand, the tawny valley of the Saurgo; on the other,
two high spurs sent out of the main range into the
plains below, beyond which lies the distant sea.
Above our heads a few clouds hung almost motionless
in the vast expanse of crystalline blue, and
seemed compact and dazzling as heaps of snow.</p>

<p>Seated on some boulders, we gazed in silence.
Violante and Massimilla seemed tired, and Oddo
had not yet succeeded in controlling his nervousness.
But Anatolia was moving about, gathering
little flowers in the crevices of the rocks.</p>

<p>A vague, confused restlessness stole over me,
intensified at times to the point of acute pain. I felt
that at last the inevitable moment of choice was
hanging over me; that I dared linger no more among
the tormenting, delicious alternations of passion and
perplexity, nor any more strive to resolve the three
noble rhythms into one harmony. That day, for the
last time, the three givers of happiness appeared to
me in unison beneath the light of the same heaven.
How long a time had passed since that first hour
when, as I ascended the ancient steps, in the voices
and virginal shadows moving like forms of magic,
surrounded by the traces of neglect and decay, I had
discovered the first music, and wrought the first
transformation? On the morrow the short-lived
spell would be broken, and for ever.</p>

<p>Now I felt compelled to say aloud to Anatolia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
the words I had already silently addressed to the
pure, mysterious shadow which had witnessed my
interview with her father. As we stood together
shortly before in the deserted chapel, looking on
that tomb erected by the loyalty of a brave woman,
had we not both partaken of the same sentiment and
the same idea? Had I not said to her even then,
without words: “Thou too mightest become a mother
of heroes, oh thou who sharest my consciousness. I
know that thou hast gathered up my wish, and hast
laid it within thy true heart, where it sparkles like
a diamond. I know that in a dream thou hast
watched a whole night mysteriously over the sleep
of a child. While his body slept, breathing deeply,
thou didst hold his soul, tangible as a crystal ball,
in thy hands, and thy bosom swelled with marvellous
intuitions.”</p>

<p>Now I felt the need of exchanging a binding promise
with her before she started off on her mournful
journey with the novice and her brother. But
my anxiety was deepening into pain, as if some real
danger were hanging over me. And I could not
fail to acknowledge the cause of the emotion which
Violante was perpetually stirring in me by her every
action.</p>

<p>The ruins of Linturno lay beneath us in the valley
like a heap of white stones, like a strip of dry shore,
in the midst of the sweet dead waters, where only
yesterday by a double miracle she had cast a spell
over the water-lilies and over my soul. The spell
was still upon me whenever I looked at her. Seated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
on a boulder in the same attitude as when seated
that first day on the plinth, she looked like one of
the immortal statues. Once again I gazed at her,
and noticed how, although present, she was yet far
away, as she had been that day; and I thought
again: “It is right she should remain untouched.
Only by a god could she be possessed without
shame. Never shall her body bear the disfiguring
weight; never shall the flood of milk mar the pure
outline of her bosom....”</p>

<p>An inward impulse made me start to my feet as if
to free myself from a restraint, and turning to her
who was gathering the little flowers in the crevices of
the rocks, I said: “As you are not tired, Anatolia,
will you come up to the top with me?”</p>

<p>“I am quite ready,” she assented in her clear cordial
voice; and she went up to Massimilla and laid the
flowers in her lap.</p>

<p>Violante sat still in the same attitude, holding her
veil between her fingers&mdash;impassive as though she
had not heard. But I felt that her eyes were not
looking at outward things, and I was troubled, as
though a ray of the fascination flowing from the
mysterious depths on which her gaze was fixed had
penetrated me.</p>

<p>“Don’t be long in coming down!” Oddo begged in
his imploring tones, his pale face betraying the discomfort,
the perpetual fear of giddiness which he felt
on those heights. “We shall wait for you.”</p>

<p>The peak of Corace rose up against the sky as bare
and sharp as a helmet, leaning over a little towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
the west; and the path ascending it ran along a steep
rib as narrow as the edge of a precipice, dividing the
two slopes. The passage was so difficult and dangerous
that I offered Anatolia my hand for support,
and, smiling, she laid hers in mine as she stumbled
over the rough rocks. We were out of sight already,
free and alone, monarchs of the vast space. Every
breath seemed to purify the blood in our veins and
to lighten the weight of the flesh. And the aromatic
essences which the heat of the sun, like a powerful
chemical, pressed out of the rare Alpine plants,
quickened the rhythm of our life.</p>

<p>We stopped, both suddenly out of breath, and
our hands, which had been too tightly clasped,
unloosed themselves. I looked in my companion’s
eyes, but she was no longer smiling. Her face became
grave, almost sad, as if overshadowed by a regret.</p>

<p>“Let us stop here,” she murmured, lowering her
eyelids. “I cannot go any further....”</p>

<p>“A little further,” I said, for a vehement desire to
reach the summit was spurring me on, “only a few
steps more, and we shall be at the top!”</p>

<p>“I cannot go any further,” she repeated in an
exhausted voice unlike her own, and she passed her
hands over her face as if to brush away something
that distressed her.</p>

<p>Then she tried to smile at me.</p>

<p>“What a strange illusion!” she added. “The top
is a long way off yet. We always seem about to
reach it, and the higher one goes, the further off it
seems to be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Then after a pause, in which she seemed to be
listening to her own deep heart&mdash;</p>

<p>“And there are souls suffering down below!”</p>

<p>She turned her face, on which the shadow of some
thought had fallen, towards the place where her
sisters were waiting.</p>

<p>“Let us go back, Claudio,” she added, in a tone
that I cannot forget, for never did human voice
express so many wonderful things so briefly.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear Anatolia!” I broke out, seizing her
hands, overcome by the extraordinary feeling aroused
in me by those simple words of hers, which I took to
be the unmistakable indication of an inward emotion
that was almost divine. “Let me first say to you
what my silence has told you more than once....
Where can I offer my love more worthily than here
on this height, to you who are the highest of created
beings, Anatolia?”</p>

<p>She turned very pale, not like one who hears tidings
of joy long waited and prayed for, but like one who
receives an invisible blow in a vital part; and though
apparently motionless, in spirit she was shaken
towards me by some strange fearful shudder, by some
instinctive movement of horror; and this I saw, not
with my eyes, but with one of those unknown senses
that sometimes manifest themselves in a momentary
vibration on the surface of the human nerves, and
then disappear again for ever, leaving the consciousness
amazed.</p>

<p>She cast a look of indefinable anxiety around
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“You speak as if we were alone,” she said vaguely,
“as if I were alone ... as if I were alone....”</p>

<p>“Anatolia, what is the matter with you?” I asked,
troubled by her inexplicable distress, by the deep
change in her face, the incoherence of her words.</p>

<p>And a thought flashed across my uncertainty.
Had she not been suddenly assailed, she accustomed
for so many years to her gloomy prison, she the
resigned martyr within the ancient walls, had she not
perhaps been suddenly assailed by that mysterious
terror, that kind of panic which reigns among the
solitudes of stern and silent mountains? Yes; no
doubt she was a prey to this terrible fascination, and
her spirit had gone astray under it.</p>

<p>A savage scene lay at our feet on every side in the
glaring light. The chain of rocks, bare and clear in
their desolate barrenness to their remotest passes,
stretched away like a mass of gigantic and monstrous
relics, left for the amazement of mankind as traces of
some primeval battle of the Titans. Ruined towers,
broken walls, fallen citadels, crumbled domes, tottering
porches, mutilated colossi, prows of vessels, backbones
of monsters, bones of Titans, every kind of
monstrosity was simulated by the jutting peaks and
dark ravines of this formidable range. The distance
was so transparent that I could distinguish every
outline as clearly as if my eyes were beholding, on
an infinitely larger scale, the rock which Violante
had shown me from the window-sill with that creative
sweep of her hand. The most distant peaks were
engraved on the sky with the same precise sharpness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
of outline which the sloping sides of the crater close
at hand assumed in the reflected rays of the sun.
The vast mouth of the spherical crater gaped with a
kind of eddying vehemence in the expression of its
curves; it was like a whirlpool, although inert. In
part grey like ashes, elsewhere red like rust, it was
crossed here and there by long white streaks that
sparkled like salt, and were reflected in the metallic
calm of the water which had gathered at the bottom.
And opposite us, overhanging the edge of the precipice
like a petrified flock of sheep, was Secli, the
solitary hermit-like village, where from time immemorial
a small industrious population has busied
itself in making strings for musical instruments.</p>

<p>“You are tired,” I said to my dear companion,
trying to draw her under the shadow of a boulder,
which I thought might screen her on one side at least
from the sight of the space below, and give her back
a sense of security. “You are tired, Anatolia; you
are not used to such fatigue, and perhaps this view is
rather terrible.... Lean back here and close your
eyes for a little. I will stand beside you. Here is
my arm. I can take you back without any danger.
Now close your eyes for a little....”</p>

<p>Again she tried to smile at me.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she said; “don’t trouble, Claudio.”</p>

<p>Then after a pause, in a changed voice, and very
low&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is not that.... If I closed my eyes, perhaps I
should see....”</p>

<p>My heart was trembling like a leaf beneath a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
breath of wind. And though Anatolia’s face was
composed again into an expression of deep but calm
sadness, and though a feeling of power over evil
seemed diffused through her whole person, vague
analogies led me to think of Antonello’s sudden
attacks of distress, of that restlessness of his, which
was an infallible warning, and of the visions of the
future which lit up his pale eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you understand, Anatolia?” I asked, taking
one of her hands, for we stood side by side leaning
against the rock. “Do you understand that you, you
alone, are the companion whose name my heart pronounced
that evening when your father kissed my
forehead in sign of consent? You rose and left the
room softly like a spirit; and I, I don’t know why,
imagined that your face was bathed in tears.... Tell
me if you are weeping, Anatolia, and if my dream was
dear to you!” She did not answer; but as I held her
hand, it seemed to me that her purest heart’s blood
flowed magnetically to the tips of her fingers.</p>

<p>“That evening,” I added, striving to intoxicate her
with hope, “as I went back to Rebursa, I saw a star
shining over one of my old towers; and your presence
had filled my heart so full of faith, that what was mere
chance seemed to me like a divine omen! From that
time two figures have shone for me in that radiance....
You know whose the other is. I can hear the
first words you spoke to me there on the steps, words
which evoked the memory of 'immense kindness.’
All that day the figure your words had called up clung
to your side to show me whom she had elected.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
She herself, on some future evening, will come with
me into the dwelling which once was full of her smile,
and now is deserted.... Look, down there!”</p>

<p>She looked at the distant towers of Rebursa down
in the deep hollow where the hanging clouds were
casting great circles of shadow; but her gaze passed
on to Trigento, and during the interval marks of an
inexpressible inward conflict passed over her face.
She shook her head, and drew her hand out of mine.</p>

<p>“Happiness is forbidden me,” she said in a firm but
sorrowful voice, keeping her eyes fixed on the garden
of her agony, on the house of her martyrdom. “I,
like Massimilla, am dedicated; and my vow also is
irrevocable. And it is not only the action of my
own will, Claudio. I feel now that the sacrifice is
necessary, that I cannot escape from it. You heard
the tone in my answer just now when you asked me
to go up to the top with you. You saw how easy it
was for me to climb with you, with the support of
your hand. But now ... I have not been able to
go any further; we did not reach the top. See: here
I am, nailed to a rock. You make me an offer, the
value of which you yourself cannot know as I know
it; and here I am, weighed down by grief so heavy
that I am afraid of being unable to bear it, I, who
have never been afraid of suffering!”</p>

<p>I dared not interrupt her nor touch her. A sort
of religious awe filled my soul. Overmastered by
even stronger emotion than had overcome me on
that solemn evening, I could feel, without turning
round, the throbbing of something infinitely noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
and mysterious at my side, something resembling the
divine mysteries guarded under veils in the Holy of
Holies in temples. Her voice was sounding close to
my ear, yet it came from an infinite distance. Her
words were simple, but they came from the summit
of life, that pinnacle which the human soul can only
reach when about to be transfigured into Ideal
Beauty.</p>

<p>“Look, down there! Look at the house where
from the first day we received you as a brother,
where our father received you as a son, where you
found the memory of your beloved dead kept fresh.
Look how far away it seems! And yet I feel it
bound to me by a thousand invisible ties stronger
than any chain. I feel that even here my life
mingles with the faint life suffering down there. Ah,
perhaps you cannot understand! But think, Claudio,
of the atrocity of the fate that hangs over us; think
of that poor raving mother, of that broken-down
feeble old man, of that victim always hovering on the
border of madness, of that other, too, who is under
the same sentence, and of the horror of contagion,
and the solitude, and the grief.... Ah, you cannot
understand! From the first day I feared to sadden
you; I always tried to put myself between you and
our misfortune. Very seldom, perhaps never, have
you breathed the real sadness of our house. We met
you in the open air, among the flowers which we
learned, for your sake only, to love again; and in our
neglected garden you have been able to bring some
things to life.... But think of the hidden anguish!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
You cannot see; but I can see from here everything
that goes on in there, as much as if the walls were
made of glass, and I were touching them with my
forehead. Life seems suspended; the father and
son are shut up in one room and dare not go out,
and dare not breathe; they listen to every sound,
one increases the suffering of the other, and both
are helplessly waiting for my return, and listening
eagerly, hoping to catch the sound of my voice and
my step. And <em>she</em> is raving, searching for me in all
the passages, all the rooms, calling me aloud, stopping
before a closed door and listening or knocking,
and my two poor souls inside hear her breathing,
and start at every knock, and can do nothing but
look in each other’s eyes, my God!”</p>

<p>She pressed her hands to her temples with an
instinctive movement, as if to force back some rebound
of sorrow; and her whole body, leaving the
support of the boulder, leant over towards the distant
scene of her martyrdom. And for a few seconds,
with the anguish she had communicated to me
clutching at my throat, I bent over in the same
attitude, I hung over the edge of the precipice, with
my gaze fixed on the distant home where those souls
were suffering.</p>

<p>“Think,” she continued, in a broken voice now,
“think, Claudio, what would happen to them if I
were not there, if I forsook them! Even when I
leave them for a short time, I feel such regret, such
remorse as I cannot describe to you. Every time I
cross the threshold to go out, a gloomy presentiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
weighs on my heart; and it seems to me as if on my
return I should find the house full of shrieks and
lamentations....”</p>

<p>An uncontrollable shudder was now shaking her
whole figure, and her eyes were dilated as if some
cruel vision were filling her with horror.</p>

<p>“Antonello,” she stammered; and for a few seconds
she could not utter another word.</p>

<p>I looked at her with inexpressible anguish; and
my soul suffered with hers in each contraction of her
dear lips. And the vision in her eyes passed into
mine; and I saw Antonello’s wasted, white face,
and the rapid quiver of his eyelids, and his painful
smile and disordered movements, and the waves of
terror which used suddenly to sweep over his long
thin body, shaking it like a fragile reed.</p>

<p>“Antonello ... tried to kill himself.... Only I
know of it.... Nobody else knows it; not even
Oddo. Alas!”</p>

<p>She trembled so much that she could not control
herself as she leant against the rock. “One evening
God warned me, God sent me.... His name be
praised for ever!... I went into his room ... and
I found him....”</p>

<p>She was choking, and her fingers wandered distractedly
to her throat, as if the noose were strangling
her; she was trembling, overcome, losing all courage
at the recollection, she who had been able to repress her
cries of horror at the sight of the half-dead man, she
who had been able to call up the strength of a man in
her wrists, to finish her work without asking for help, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
hide the horrible secret in her own bosom, and then
to live on from one fear to another, from one anxiety
to another, with this tragic vision haunting her soul!
Thus she revealed herself to me in her sublime truth,
desperately devoted to an affection which had its
roots in the deepest and most sacred instincts of her
being. The voice of blood seemed to cry aloud in all
her veins: the ties of blood bound every fibre together.
She was born to wear the sweet powerful
fetters till death. She was ready to burn herself as a
sacrifice that she might nourish the faint flame that
flickered on the household hearth. And therefore
with what unspeakable love would she have loved
the child of her womb!</p>

<p>“You speak of forsaking,” I said, making a painful
effort to speak, for any expressions of mine seemed
untimely and feeble after the grandeur and beauty
of the sentiment just revealed; “you speak of
forsaking, Anatolia; and you forget that from the
very first day I found my father, my sisters, and my
brothers in your house; and you do not know how
full my heart is of filial and fraternal piety, not comparable
to yours, which is superhuman, but still
worthy of serving it by actions....”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Ah, Claudio,” she replied, with a sorrowful smile
on her dry lips, “your generosity deceives you. My
soul is still dazzled by the flames of your dream, and
troubled by a sort of repressed violence and dangerous
ardour which from time to time flashes from you.
You are stirred by the longing for strife and power;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
and you are determined by every means to force life
to fulfil her promises to you. You are young and
proud of your lineage, and lord of your own powers,
and confident in your faith. Who shall set a limit
to your conquests?”</p>

<p>As if suddenly inspired, she had thrown the whole
virtue of her clear, warm voice into these last words;
and I understood by the thrill they sent through me
what a powerful stimulator of energy she would have
been, she who with all her kindness and patience
possessed the fundamental instincts of her imperious
race.</p>

<p>“But imagine, Claudio, a conqueror dragging after
him a cart full of sick folk, and seeing their wasted
faces and hearing their lamentations as he prepared
himself for battle! Can you imagine such a thing?
If life is cruel, he who is resolved to combat her must
of necessity take into account the strength of the
enemy; and every hindrance will sooner or later
arouse his annoyance and his anger....”</p>

<p>She had succeeded in mastering the excess of her
emotion; and once more I beheld her brave firmness
as she spoke on without a quiver in her voice.</p>

<p>“And I, my very self, should I not at last be forgotten?
Should I not be carried away altogether on
the stream of new affections, new cares, by the
intoxication of your hopes? The task you would
assign to the companion of your efforts is too great,
Claudio.... Your words are still in my memory....
Alas, it is not possible to feed two flames at the same
time! The new one would in a short time become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
so voracious that I should have to sacrifice all the
riches of my soul to it; and the old one so feeble,
that if I turned my head away it would go out.”</p>

<p>She was silent, and her head sank again. But with
a sudden movement, as if her former anxiety had
returned, she looked up and around her, and the
working of her parched lips betrayed her thirst to
me. Then she turned upon me, and fixing her eyes
on mine with a kind of impetuous force, she asked&mdash;</p>

<p>“Is it true that your heart has chosen me? Have
you examined your heart to the depths? Or does
some illusion hang over you like a veil?”</p>

<p>I was so much disturbed by her look, and these
sudden doubts of hers, that I felt myself turn pale as
if she had accused me of falsehood.</p>

<p>“Anatolia, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>She left the support of the rock, and made a few
faltering steps forward; then she paused as if to
listen, anxious and agitated.</p>

<p>“There is some soul suffering here on these paths,”
she repeated, in the same tone as before; for a few
moments she stood perplexed, and her hand went
up to her brow with a vague gesture.</p>

<p>Then turning to me, rapidly, anxiously, as if she
were being driven on, and was afraid of not having
time to say the words&mdash;</p>

<p>“To-morrow I am going away. I must go with
Massimilla. I have not the courage to let her start
alone with Oddo. I must go with her to the very
door of her retreat. She is going to pray for us....
I know she is not going there for consolation, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
as to death; and so I must help her. I shall stay
away for several days. For several days one of us
will be alone at Trigento.... She is the eldest; she
has almost the right.... She is worthy.... I don’t
know; your heart will tell you something, perhaps
the truth.... I swear to you, Claudio, that I will
pray with all the fervour I have in my soul that on
coming back I may find that everything has fallen
out for the good of all.... Who knows? Perhaps
there is some great good in store for you. I believe
in your star, Claudio. But I am under a prohibition.... I
can’t explain, I can’t explain.... There is a
shadow over my will.... Just now a strange fear
came over me, and then a sadness, a sadness I had
never known before....”</p>

<p>She stopped, gasping, confused, miserable, as if the
feeling of the infinite desolation spreading round us
under the burning heat had swept over her again.</p>

<p>“And you too, how you are suffering!” she murmured,
without looking at me.</p>

<p>And stretching out both her hands to me in one
supreme effort&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now, good-bye! we must go back. Thank
you, Claudio. Remember me always as a devoted
sister. You will never find my tenderness wanting....”</p>

<p>She turned away her face, for her eyes were filling
with tears, and I kissed both her hands.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she repeated, trying to get up and
begin the descent; but she tottered on the rock.</p>

<p>“I entreat you, Anatolia, stay a little longer!” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
implored, as I held her up. “Just stay a few minutes
longer here in the shade, that you may get back
your strength.... The descent is very steep.”</p>

<p>“They are waiting for us! They are waiting for
us!” she stammered, almost beside herself, and her
frenzied anxiety communicated itself to me. “Let
us go, Claudio! I will lean on you. If we stayed
any longer, I should feel worse, I should not be able
to go one step.... Ah, this horrible thirst!”</p>

<p>I could see well enough that her poor mouth was
burning with thirst, and such anguish of pity was I
enduring that I would have opened a vein to slake
it. There was not a trace of water anywhere around.
Nothing but the waters of the lake looking like
molten lead at the bottom of the extinct crater.
Rapid visions crossed my brain, as they do in the
delirium of fever; the great, rosy river covered with
water-lilies, Violante leaning over the edge of the
boat, her face bending to breathe the moisture of the
flowers, the hardness of a sharp glance from under
her knitted brows....</p>

<p>But we both started, as a sudden wave of sound
came rolling towards us, we knew not whence. The
silence in these lofty solitudes was so intense as to
seem inviolable, and the rough, sudden breaking of
it struck us, in the confused state of our senses, as an
extraordinary event. Anatolia clung to my arm,
and questioned me with startled eyes.</p>

<p>“Secli,” I said, as I recognised the nature of the
sound. “The bells of Secli.”</p>

<p>And we listened, side by side, leaning towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
echoing crater, in the shadow thrown over our heads
by the boulder.</p>

<p>The empty crater, resonant as a gigantic drum,
echoed back the waves of sound sent by the quivering
bells, and mingled them into one long hollow rumble
that repeated itself indefinitely through the solitudes
of light. All through those solitudes, where primary
matter, petrified into a thousand expressions of rage
and sorrow, shone in its grandeur, down the tawny
valley furrowed by the winding river, through the
Alpine vegetation sloping away to the distant sea,
everywhere the voice of bronze, modulated by the
terrible fiery mouth, went proclaiming its mysterious
message. Further and further it penetrated, and
further still again, through limitless space, away to
shores beyond the mountains and the sea, away
to where my weary sight failed me, away to where
my thoughts, still unformed and uncontrolled, but
instinct with mysterious creative power, wandered
like winds laden with pollen. A grand, vague feeling,
in which innumerable things of sorrow and joy, past
and future, of death and life, were mingled, troubled
my consciousness, and seemed tossing it to and fro
as the storm tosses the ocean.</p>

<p>Amazed, I looked down at the Tartarean lake,
thick and stagnant like the blind eye of a subterranean
world; and I looked at the greedy crater
where the impetus of the primeval fire had been
arrested, just as the contracted expression of the last
agony sometimes lingers on the lips of corpses. And
my gaze rested on the humble cottages of Secli, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
that fragile nest, hardly distinguishable from the
rock on which it hung. And I had a fantastic vision
of that unconscious taciturn race, busied from time
immemorial in turning the entrails of lambs into
musical strings destined to express through the
language of art the highest inspirations of life, and to
intoxicate myriads of unknown souls in the world.</p>

<p>On and on rolled the sound, rumbling ceaselessly,
monotonously, through the scorching air. And seeing
my companion motionless at my side, I dared
not speak, nor break the spell. But suddenly she
turned round and broke into sobs, as if she had just
witnessed the end of a death agony. Leaning against
the rock with her face in her hands, she sobbed on
despairingly.</p>

<p>“Anatolia, Anatolia, what is the matter with you?
Answer me, Anatolia! Say one word to me.”</p>

<p>And unable to resist the pain, I was just going to
take her wrists and uncover her face.</p>

<p>I heard close by the sound of a swift step on the
stones, the sound of painful breathing; I saw a
shadow.</p>

<p>“You, Violante?”</p>

<p>She came up the steep rock with something of the
elastic stride of a wild animal, something hostile and
malevolent expressed in her whole person. Her thick
blue veil was wrapped round her head in such a way
that her whole face was hidden down to the chin, as
if by a mask, and her eyes glittered through the
gauze.</p>

<p>She stopped near the boulder in a hostile attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
throwing back her head like one who is suffocating,
yet she did not loosen her veil. The vehemence of
her breathing made her bosom rise and fall, and the
veil flutter; an uncontrollable tremor shook her
hands within the torn gloves she wore, torn probably
on the sharp rocks in some perilous fall.</p>

<p>“We waited for you,” she said at last in a broken
voice that almost hissed; “we waited for you a long
time.... As you did not seem to be coming back,
I came up ... to meet you....”</p>

<p>I could trace the convulsive motion of her lips
through her veil; I could guess at the change in her
face behind that suffocating blue mask that she
would not lift up. And I felt my inward emotion
increase so violently every minute, that it was
impossible for me to open my lips. But I felt that
not on me alone the necessity for silence had fallen.</p>

<p>The rumble of the bronze bells reverberating in
the crater passed ceaselessly over our heads.</p>

<p>Anatolia had stopped sobbing, but the traces of
tears were still on her face, and the eyelids that she
kept lowered were red. “Let us go,” she said softly,
without looking either at me or at her sister.</p>

<p>And in silence, under the desolation of the sunshine,
we began the descent, accompanied by the
rumbling sound.</p>

<p>Miserable descent, which seemed as if it would
never end! They walked on, or lingered behind,
according to the necessities of the path; and I supported
sometimes the one, and sometimes the other,
when their steps faltered. Every now and then my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
heart failed me with the fear of seeing them succumb.
When the bells of Secli ceased ringing we felt a
momentary relief; but we discovered immediately
that the oppressive irregularity of our breathing in
the stillness of the air increased our suffering, and
we felt as though we could hear only too distinctly
the murmur of the blood in our veins.</p>

<p>With a savage pertinacity Violante persisted in
braving suffocation under her blue mask. No doubt
her throat must be parched with a horrible thirst,
like mine, like her sister’s. When I took her hand
to help her down, I saw a little blood where the skin
had been grazed through the rents in her glove;
and with deep emotion I remembered the hill-slope
covered with flowers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Later on, when we reached the level ground, where
my men were waiting with the mules, and where we
rested awhile parched with thirst and exhausted by
fatigue, I composed the beauty and the sorrow of the
three princesses, for the last time, into a harmony of
infinite beauty and pain.</p>

<p>They were not in their cloistered garden, yet a
rocky cloister worthy of their souls and their fate
was surrounding them, for strange and grand was the
aspect of the scenery around. The rocks, standing
round in a circle of varying height, made one think
of some amphitheatre built by Cyclopean hands,
worn away, indeed, by centuries and storms without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
number, yet still remaining like stupendous ruins.
Fragments of unknown writing were traceable there,
incomprehensible riddles of Life and Death; the
twisted veins of the stone were channels for the essence
of a divine thought; and the lines of the shapeless
masses were as full of meaning as the attitudes of
perfect statues.</p>

<p>There we rested, there I caught their final harmony.</p>

<p>A field labourer&mdash;very like the one who had cut
the branches of almond blossom for us with his bill-hook&mdash;showed
us the way to a spring hidden in the
hollow of a rock. The clear, icy water spurted out
with a gentle murmur, and on the pool beneath
floated a rustic cup made of bark, cracked and
bottomless, like the useless husk of some fruit.</p>

<p>I offered Anatolia another cup, which the man had
brought with him. But Violante, without waiting,
raised her veil, and bending over the sparkling spring,
drank in long draughts like a wild animal.</p>

<p>I saw the drops glistening on her mouth and chin
when she rose, but she turned away suddenly and
drew down the edge of her veil. Thus veiled, she sat
down on the stone nearest to the mountain spring,
whose song was too gentle for her taste; and her
attitude awakened in my soul all the magic spell of
her own fountains. Even in fatigue she did not let
her figure relax; for now she sat almost rigidly erect,
sustained by her silent angry pride. Once again
everything around her seemed to acknowledge the
sovereignty of her presence; secret analogies bound
up the surrounding mysteries with her mystery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
Once again she seemed to drive back my spirit into
the furthest distances of time, towards the ancient
ideas of Beauty and Sorrow. She was present, and
yet far away. And in the silence she seemed to be
informing me, like the Princess Dejanira: “I possess
an ancient gift from an old centaur, hidden in a
vessel of bronze.”</p>

<p>Anatolia had sat down beside her pensive brother;
she had thrown one arm round his neck, and her
brow seemed gradually to clear as if some inner light
were rising. Massimilla seemed to be listening to
the faint, unquenchable voice of the spring; sitting
with the fingers of her hands clasped together, holding
within them the weary knee.</p>

<p>Over our heads the sky bore no traces of clouds,
save a slight shadow like the ashes of a burnt-out
funeral pyre. The sun was scorching the peaks all
around, outlining their solemn features on the blue
sky. A great sadness and a great sweetness fell
from above into the lonely circle, like a magic
draught into a rough goblet.</p>

<p>There the three sisters rested, there I caught their
final harmony.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
